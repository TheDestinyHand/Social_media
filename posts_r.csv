1jrq3mj;Conservative;Are Tariffs worth the turmoil? short answer, YES.  Long answer:;"**To my fellow Conservatives and to the lurking Dems thinking that these tariffs make the consumer pay more, buy less, hurt the economy, and drag down the stock market, you're 100% correct.**  But as I see it, there are two potential positive outcomes: either the tariffs are temporary and are being used as leverage to bring countries and/or companies that refuse to negotiate in good faith to the table (meaning the tariffs are eventually lifted), or they’re here to stay, in which case the resulting ""tax"" burden must be offset with other incentives that put or keep more money in people’s pockets. Otherwise, it will be a colossal failure that hurts the country and the Republicans in the long run.  Yesterday was Day 1 of the broad tariffs. Today is Day 2. Trump either cooks or gets cooked. Time will tell.  **And if you're thinking, ""Time will tell"" playing with people’s retirement funds and incomes is no way to run a country, lol. People don’t have “time” to just wait it out.**  The story of the country known as the USA already has a written ending, a bad one. The national debt will break this country sooner or later. Both Republicans and Democrats have made promises and done things ""for the people"". Some periods have been better than others, but the fundamental problem continues to grow.  The country itself is the one running out of time. We're speeding towards a wall, regardless of how “good”  the president in office may ""drive"" towards it.  I understand the worries, complaints, and pain this might cause. I'm not saying it's not real. But the same old, tested methods won’t change our course. The USA needs a different path. Otherwise, we’re just making the “belly of the beast” more comfortable while we wait for the very predictable outcome.  Most people think and act based on short-term gratification, I get that. I even understand it. But we need a different solution. So I think it's worth giving the elected president a shot at trying to fix things. It might not work out as he intends, but as the elected and sitting president, he’s earned the right to do things differently.  And hey, if it doesn’t work, the Democrats will win a bunch of future elections and fix everything, right?";tariffs worth turmoil short answer yes long answer fellow conservative lurk dems think tariff consumer pay buy hurt economy drag stock market correct potential positive outcome tariff temporary leverage bring country company refuse negotiate good faith table mean tariff eventually lift stay case result tax burden offset incentive money people pocket colossal failure hurt country republicans long run yesterday day broad tariff today day trump cook get cook time tell think time tell play people retirement fund income way run country lol people time wait story country know usa write ending bad national debt break country soon later republicans democrats promise thing people period well fundamental problem continue grow country run time speed wall regardless good president office drive understand worry complaint pain cause say real old test method will change course usa need different path make belly beast comfortable wait predictable outcome people think act base short term gratification understand need different solution think worth give elect president shot try fix thing work intend elected sit president earn right thing differently hey work democrats win bunch future election fix right;Bravest_Coward;702;0.61;953;2025-04-04 23:41:34;Flaired Users Only;0

1jrpwqf;Conservative;Everyone’s focused on tariffs, but I think Trump’s building something way bigger.;**TL,DR:**   Trump’s tariffs aren’t random—they’re part of a broader plan to rebuild the U.S. economy from the inside out. The goal? Bring back manufacturing, lower taxes, boost domestic energy, and create real jobs. Since January 2025, companies like TSMC, Apple, Ford, and Eli Lilly have announced trillions in new U.S. investments. Job growth is already trending up. But the plan needs time—and better messaging. The administration should focus less on defending policy and more on inspiring people with a clear vision: more take-home pay, cheaper goods, and a real shot at the American dream.  I’ve seen a lot of takes flying around—especially on TikTok and Reddit—saying Trump’s tariffs are just him going off the rails or trying to tank the economy on purpose. But if you actually sit down and map out what’s happening, the moves make a lot more sense.  This isn’t about chaos. It’s about trying to rebuild the U.S. economy from the ground up—restructure trade, production, taxes, energy, all of it. And believe it or not, there’s already a ton of investment starting to flow back in.  Before income tax was a thing (pre-1913), tariffs were how the U.S. funded itself. No paycheck tax—just taxes on imported goods. That helped protect early American industries from getting undercut by cheap labor overseas. It worked. For a long time.  Then after WWII, we started doing global trade deals. Great in theory—cheaper goods, more trade. But we lowered our barriers, and most other countries didn’t. So now we’re stuck with trade deficits, outsourced jobs, and almost everything we use—from cars to medicine to microchips—being made somewhere else.  The tariffs aren’t random. They’re what he’s calling reciprocal tariffs: if another country slaps a 100% tax on our cars, we’ll do the same to theirs. If they drop it, we’ll drop it. Simple leverage.  But that’s just the surface. The deeper goal is to make it more attractive (and necessary) to build here. If importing gets expensive, manufacturing in the U.S. starts to make sense again.  **From what I can tell, here's the high level plan:**  * Bring manufacturing back home * Cut taxes for regular people and small businesses * Replace the IRS with something called the External Revenue Service (funded by tariffs and consumption, not income) * Lower corporate taxes to boost investment * Become a major energy exporter—oil, gas, refining, etc. * Use DOGE and other legislation to drastically reduce government spending, waste, fraud and abuse * Use all of this to strengthen the dollar, pay down the debt, and create a booming economy  It’s basically: stop taxing workers, stop relying on foreign production, and make the U.S. the best place in the world to build things again.  **Is it working?**  So far several big companies, even a couple countries, have announced massive investments.  **Apple** announced in early March $500 billion over four years for facilities, manufacturing, and projects, including a new server factory in Texas. [https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/)  **Stellantis** set to reopen the Belvidere, Illinois, plant and enhance U.S. manufacturing. [https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/01/22/stellantis-reopen-belvidere-2027-uaw](https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/01/22/stellantis-reopen-belvidere-2027-uaw)  **GE Aerospace** to invest $1 billion across 16 states opening factories, supply chain nearly double from last year, with plans to hire 5,000 U.S. workers. [https://www.geaerospace.com/news/press-releases/ge-aerospace-invest-nearly-1b-us-manufacturing-2025](https://www.geaerospace.com/news/press-releases/ge-aerospace-invest-nearly-1b-us-manufacturing-2025)  **Eli Lilly and Company** plans to more than double U.S. manufacturing investment, exceeding $50 billion. [https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-plans-more-double-us-manufacturing-investment-2020](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-plans-more-double-us-manufacturing-investment-2020)  **TSMC** Intends to Expand Its Investment in the United States to US$165 Billion [https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3210](https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/3210)  **Honda** to produce next Civic in Indiana, not Mexico, due to US tariffs [https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/honda-produce-next-civic-indiana-not-mexico-due-us-tariffs-sources-say-2025-03-03/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/honda-produce-next-civic-indiana-not-mexico-due-us-tariffs-sources-say-2025-03-03/)  **Nissan** suggested President Trump’s tariffs could force the car manufacturer to shift its production outside of Mexico [https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/top-automaker-could-move-some-production-out-mexico-amid-trump-tariff-talks-ceo-says](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/top-automaker-could-move-some-production-out-mexico-amid-trump-tariff-talks-ceo-says)  **SoftBank** and Trump announce $100 billion investment in US over the next 4 years [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/16/softbank-ceo-to-announce-100-billion-investment-in-us-during-visit-with-trump.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/16/softbank-ceo-to-announce-100-billion-investment-in-us-during-visit-with-trump.html)  **Saudi Arabia** intends to invest US$600 billion in the U.S. during call with Trump [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2025/01/23/saudi-crown-prince-says-kingdom-intends-to-invest-us600-billion-in-us/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2025/01/23/saudi-crown-prince-says-kingdom-intends-to-invest-us600-billion-in-us/)  **How is this affecting the US labor market?**  Well, its a little too early to tell, but initial results are looking positive. In March 2025, the U.S. added 228,000 jobs, unemployment did have a slight increase up to 4.2%, and construction and manufacturing saw modest gains. [https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-beats-expectations-march-2025-04-04/?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-beats-expectations-march-2025-04-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  **Moving Forward and How Trump Should Position This**  Right now, the administration needs to stop explaining and start inspiring. People don’t want a defense of tariffs—they want to hear how this turns into jobs, cheaper goods, and a shot at the American dream again. The message is simple: we’re rebuilding the economy for you. New factories mean real work, more money in your pocket, and the return of strong communities—homes, schools, small businesses, opportunity.  Trump’s team needs to get out there—podcasts, interviews, wherever—and make the case clearly: less tax, more take-home pay, cheaper energy, and a path to homeownership. It’s not about spin, it’s about showing people what’s possible and what’s already in motion. Lead with the vision, not the fight.     **EDIT**:  Several countries have already reached out to Trump for tariff negotiations.  **Mexico** [https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-will-not-enter-tariff-tit-for-tat-with-us-president-says-2025-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-will-not-enter-tariff-tit-for-tat-with-us-president-says-2025-04-02/)  **Vietnam, India and Israel** have entered talks over trade deals [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/04/donald-trump-fires-nsa-tim-haugh-tariffs-us-politics-latest-updates-news](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/04/donald-trump-fires-nsa-tim-haugh-tariffs-us-politics-latest-updates-news);focus tariff think trump building way big trump tariff random broad plan rebuild economy inside goal bring manufacturing low taxis boost domestic energy create real job january company like tsmc apple ford eli lilly announce trillion new investment job growth trend plan need time well message administration focus defend policy inspire people clear vision home pay cheap good real shot american dream see lot take fly especially tiktok reddit say trump tariff go rail try tank economy purpose actually sit map happen move lot sense chaos try rebuild economy ground restructure trade production taxis energy believe ton investment start flow income tax thing tariff fund paycheck tax taxis import good help protect early american industry get undercut cheap labor overseas work long time wwii start global trade deal great theory cheap good trade lower barrier country stick trade deficit outsourced job use car medicine microchip tariff random call reciprocal tariff country slap tax car theirs drop drop simple leverage surface deep goal attractive necessary build import get expensive manufacture start sense tell high level plan bring manufacturing home cut taxis regular people small business replace irs call external revenue service fund tariff consumption income low corporate taxis boost investment major energy exporter oil gas refining etc use doge legislation drastically reduce government spending waste fraud abuse use strengthen dollar pay debt create booming economy basically stop tax worker stop rely foreign production good place world build thing work far big company couple country announce massive investment apple announce early march billion year facility manufacturing project include new server factory texas stellantis set reopen belvidere illinois plant enhance manufacturing ge aerospace invest billion state open factory supply chain nearly double year plan hire worker eli lilly company plan double manufacturing investment exceed billion tsmc intend expand investment united states billion honda produce civic indiana mexico tariff nissan suggest president trump tariff force car manufacturer shift production outside mexico softbank trump announce billion investment year saudi arabia intend invest billion trump affect labor market little early tell initial result look positive march add job unemployment slight increase construction manufacturing see modest gain move forward trump position right administration need stop explain start inspire people want defense tariff want hear turn job cheap good shot american dream message simple rebuild economy new factory mean real work money pocket return strong community home school small business opportunity trump team need podcast interview case clearly tax home pay cheap energy path homeownership spin show people possible motion lead vision fight edit country reach trump tariff negotiation mexico vietnam india israel enter talk trade deal;SleekFilet;13;0.74;14;2025-04-04 23:32:08;Flaired Users Only;0

1jqm6fn;Conservative;What Trump is trying to do with tariffs;"TL,DR he is trying to answer the question of whether it is better to have cheap stuff to buy or have higher salaries.  About 50 years ago, globalism started becoming a thing. The idea was, lower barriers to trade and make the world a better place. Countries with cheaper labor would make good cheaply, and export those goods to developed countries like the USA. The USA in turn would shift from making things to providing services, making the country richer overall.  Everyone benefits - the people in the USA benefit from cheaper goods because they are imported from cheaper countries while enjoying higher salaries because everyone now has a cushy service job. The third world countries get to develop because they are selling goods for American dollars.  At least, that is the dream we were sold. But that's not the reality. Yes we can buy cheap stuff from Temu, but real wages have stagnated for decades - around the time that globalism was introduced. Globalism, as it turns out, was less beneficial to American consumers than it was to the corporations who reaped massive profits due to these changes.  And so for the last 50 years, globalism, and the things that it depends upon, namely elimination of trade barriers, have become accepted as normal and desirable. Nobody questioned them - nobody dared to question them. ""Everybody knows"" that tariffs are bad and being protectionist is bad and globalism is good, and just don't question it okay?  Except, as it turns out, globalism has its problems too, and one of that, if you aren't protectionist, you allow your own industry to become decimated, and this leads to depressed wages for the people in your country. This is exactly what has happened and exactly why Canada charges such high tariffs on dairy imports from the USA - it is trying to protect its own dairy industry.  This is what Trump means when he says that those trade deals are unfair. They were created when the countries in question had smaller economies, and so it ""made sense"" to protect them from American imports. But now it doesn't anymore.  Trump's whole plan is to shift manufacturing back to the USA, so that the USA becomes a net exporter again. He knows that he only has a limited time in order to accomplish this, because anything he does could be undone by the next administration, especially because he is using EOs to accomplish them. That's why there is such a rush. It gives everyone 3 years to see if the new normal is better than how it was before. I wager that it will be, but we're in for 3 years of pain. Then expect to see wage growth takeoff like it hasn't in a long time.  If the mainstream media is telling you that tariffs are a Bad Thing, that should make you very skeptical.";trump try tariff try answer question well cheap stuff buy high salary year ago globalism start thing idea low barrier trade world well place country cheap labor good cheaply export good develop country like usa usa turn shift make thing provide service make country rich overall benefit people usa benefit cheap good import cheap country enjoy high salary cushy service job world country develop sell good american dollar dream sell reality yes buy cheap stuff temu real wage stagnate decade time globalism introduce globalism turn beneficial american consumer corporation reap massive profit change year globalism thing depend elimination trade barrier accept normal desirable question dare question everybody know tariff bad protectionist bad globalism good question okay turn globalism problem protectionist allow industry decimated lead depressed wage people country exactly happen exactly canada charge high tariff dairy import usa try protect dairy industry trump mean say trade deal unfair create country question small economy sense protect american import anymore trump plan shift manufacturing usa usa net exporter know limited time order accomplish undo administration especially eo accomplish rush give year new normal well wager year pain expect wage growth takeoff like long time mainstream media tell tariff bad thing skeptical;AngelOfLastResort;633;0.6;979;2025-04-03 15:57:34;Flaired Users Only;0

1jqkkay;Conservative;Destination-based cash flow taxation (DBCFT) as a Tariff Alternative;Apologies for the nerdy policy discussion   The right wing policy whiz kids some years ago spent a lot of time thinking about various tax systems to encourage the behaviors around domestic job creation with the least inadvertent pain and came up with DBCFT which was in some early Trump tax proposals.   Tariffs do have a lot of pain and are also blunt force and tend to be subjective by country. DBCFT is an alternative that is country agnostic and encourages American jobs with a max effective tariff rate likely in the high teens. I’d also heavily encourages new investment. It gives massive tax advantage to corporations that primarily make stuff here.   The TLDR is simply that corporations can deduct costs accrued in the U.S., but can’t deduct costs accrued on imports. Then corporate tax is applied to the profits. Additionally, exports are entirely untaxed as revenue. In other words, imports don’t get deducted as a cost, and exports don’t get taxed as a revenue.   It has some other great features like allowing 100% immediate deduction of any capital expenditures like new factories as opposed to the current tax code which allows it over a decade or more.  The country could ease into this with a gradual set of rules (such as, imports 75% deductible year 1, 50% deductible year two, etc, similar on the exports). Or you could reduce the ratios such as 50% of export revenue counted only and 50% of imports deducted only and still create the incentive.   Here’s a longer article on this:  https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/trump-should-finish-what-he-started  Trump is demolishing a lot of stale or counter productive stuff but he also needs to build. I don’t think tariffs are the right tool to get what he wants(and have limited optimal uses such as countering dumping), I think new better policies like this should be on the table.    ;destination base cash flow taxation dbcft tariff alternative apologies nerdy policy discussion right wing policy whiz kid year ago spend lot time think tax system encourage behavior domestic job creation inadvertent pain come dbcft early trump tax proposal tariff lot pain blunt force tend subjective country dbcft alternative country agnostic encourage american job max effective tariff rate likely high teen heavily encourage new investment give massive tax advantage corporation primarily stuff tldr simply corporation deduct cost accrue deduct cost accrue import corporate tax apply profit additionally export entirely untaxe revenue word import deduct cost export tax revenue great feature like allow immediate deduction capital expenditure like new factory oppose current tax code allow decade country ease gradual set rule import deductible year deductible year etc similar export reduce ratio export revenue count import deduct create incentive long article trump demolish lot stale counter productive stuff need build think tariff right tool limit optimal use counter dumping think new well policy like table;Unlucky-Prize;36;0.84;5;2025-04-03 14:54:45;Flaired Users Only;0

Tariffs disrupt that easy extraction. They create actual jobs and increase actual production. The media consensus is they’re THE WORST THING EVER because the media is aligned with corporations, advertisers, and banks. “$40 more for a microwave!” is the problem, not “offshoring, job losses, stagnant wages, and national security.”  So, Democrats oppose them because they’re (SUDDENLY) concerned about affordability and inflation, and Republicans oppose them because they hurt their donors (Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski ACTUALLY admitted this out loud) and violates “muh boomer Reaganite free-trade pRiNCiPLeS!”  Watch this and tell me which side you’re really on, “fellow conservatives:” https://tinyurl.com/5n7u3uja  EDIT: Straw man arguments are retarded, and so are you if you use one, so think twice.

Farmers in Israel are opposed. However, the Knesset must approve the cancellation.  Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich signed an order this evening (Tuesday) that eliminates all tariffs on imports of agricultural products from the United States. The order was signed hastily, in coordination with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to advance the entry into force tomorrow of the order imposing tariffs (""Liberation Day"") signed by US President Donald Trump, in the hope that Israel will be exempted from it. As it has become known, farmers in Israel oppose the signing of the order to eliminate tariffs from the United States. In 2024, exports of goods to the United States were $17.3 billion, and exports of services were estimated at $16.7 billion.  According to an inspection by the Tax Authority and the Chief Economist's Department at the Ministry of Finance, customs duties on imports from the US currently amount to only 42 million shekels per year, when in fact all imports from the US are completely exempt from customs duties in Israel, except for agricultural products.  The authority to finally abolish tariffs in Israel lies with the Knesset, and it is not yet clear when it will be asked to approve the order. It should be noted that the Knesset is currently on recess, but there will be no problem approving the order in the Finance Committee, which will meet during the recess anyway.  https://www.ynet.co.il/economy/article/bym11aotayx ";israel cancel stand tarrif product trump order go effect smotrich cancel tariff import minister finance sign order evening eliminate tariff import agricultural product united states order advance entry force tomorrow order impose tariff sign president hope israel exempt farmer israel opposed knesset approve cancellation finance minister bezalel smotrich sign order evening tuesday eliminate tariff import agricultural product united states order sign hastily coordination prime minister benjamin netanyahu advance entry force tomorrow order impose tariff liberation day sign president donald trump hope israel exempt know farmer israel oppose signing order eliminate tariff united states export good united states billion export service estimate billion accord inspection tax authority chief economist department ministry finance custom duty import currently million shekel year fact import completely exempt custom duty israel agricultural product authority finally abolish tariff israel lie knesset clear ask approve order note knesset currently recess problem approve order finance committee meet recess;poincares_cook;55;0.91;4;2025-04-01 16:42:58;Flaired Users Only;0

1jox9gu;Conservative;This Is How You Lose the Average Vote;The leftists who are now attacking anyone who owns a Tesla are starting to affect people I actually know. A friend’s father has owned a Tesla for years—long before all this Elon Musk hysteria kicked off—and he’s definitely not someone I’d describe as a MAGA Republican by any stretch. He’s a kind, older guy, an Air Force veteran who now flies for Southwest Airlines.  He was driving in Arizona, minding his own business, when a random motorcyclist cut him off, pulled in front of his car at a four line intersection at a red light, kicked up his bike stand, and started approaching the vehicle while yelling. That’s when my friend’s dad pulled his handgun to deter the guy from attacking his car. The gentleman then proceeded to pull out his phone, record the vehicle and prevented him from leaving the intersection when the lights turned green.  From the Tesla’s dashcam footage I saw, there was no way for him to escape. The biker had trapped him—no exit to the right, a car directly behind, and the left led straight into four lanes of oncoming traffic. He was boxed in, plain and simple. thankfully, there was a bit of an opening for him to escape and that is what he did.  This is the first time this kind of mass hysteria has directly put someone I care about in danger, and I’m honestly pissed. It’s insane that people assume anyone who owns a Tesla—regardless of when they bought it—is automatically some Elon Musk-loving MAGA Republican. This mindset is going to get someone seriously hurt or killed.  What really blows my mind is that the left doesn’t seem to realize how much this kind of behavior is pushing away normal, everyday voters. Instead of learning from their mistakes, they’re doubling down on the exact rhetoric that lost them the election in the first place.  EDIT:   For context here, the police were called and they did say that he was completely justified in what he did. They even mentioned that they could pursue kidnapping charges because of the way that the motorcycle boxed him in, but he decided not to pursue in charges.   EDIT 2:  For those of you who are asking me to publish the dash cam footage, that is not my footage to publish. My friend simply messaged me and told me about this incident because she thought that I would find it interesting. If her father decides that he would like to upload the footage, then we can cross that bridge when we get there, but otherwise I will not be publishing the footage without permission.   EDIT 3:  To those saying he should have pressed charges—I get where you’re coming from, but not everyone has the time or energy to go through the exhausting process of a criminal case. Pressing charges isn’t as simple as signing a form and moving on. It often means sitting through multiple interviews, taking time off work to attend court dates, and staying engaged in a drawn-out legal process that can take weeks or even months.  This man is a commercial pilot with a demanding schedule. Asking him to drop everything to pursue a case—especially one where no physical contact was made and the guy would likely just get a slap on the wrist—is a big ask. If it were me, I would press charges, sure. But not everyone is as politically motivated or plugged into the culture war as we are.  Obviously, if the guy had laid hands on the car or assaulted him, this would be a totally different situation. But in this case, I completely understand why he chose to prioritize his own time and safety over a court battle that probably wouldn’t go anywhere. ;lose average vote leftist attack own tesla start affect people actually know friend father own tesla year long elon musk hysteria kick definitely describe maga republican stretch kind old guy air force veteran fly southwest airlines drive arizona mind business random motorcyclist cut pull car line intersection red light kick bike stand start approach vehicle yell friend dad pull handgun deter guy attack car gentleman proceed pull phone record vehicle prevent leave intersection light turn green tesla dashcam footage see way escape biker trap exit right car directly left lead straight lane oncoming traffic box plain simple thankfully bit opening escape time kind mass hysteria directly care danger honestly piss insane people assume own tesla regardless buy automatically elon musk love maga republican mindset go seriously hurt kill blow mind left realize kind behavior push away normal everyday voter instead learn mistake double exact rhetoric lose election place edit context police call completely justify mention pursue kidnapping charge way motorcycle box decide pursue charge edit ask publish dash cam footage footage publish friend simply message tell incident think find interesting father decide like upload footage cross bridge publish footage permission edit say press charge come time energy exhausting process criminal case press charge simple sign form move mean sit multiple interview take time work attend court date stay engage draw legal process week month man commercial pilot demanding schedule ask drop pursue case especially physical contact guy likely slap wrist big ask press charge sure politically motivated plug culture war obviously guy lay hand car assault totally different situation case completely understand choose prioritize time safety court battle probably;CartridgeCrusader23;1826;0.76;579;2025-04-01 14:41:16;Flaired Users Only;0

You are simply cutting down ""the national income"" and helping to bring out or intensify a depression.   Once again the fallaxy comes from looking at the effects of this action only on the disimissed officeholders themselves and on the particular tradesmen who depend upon them. Once again it is forgotten that, if these bureaucrats are not retained in office, the taxpayers will be permitted to keep the money that was formerly taken from them for the support of the bureaucrats. Once again it is fotgotten that the taxpayers' income and purchasing power go up by at least as mych as the income and purchasing power of the former officeholders go down.

1jm2ohq;Conservative;Any other conservative minorities feel this way?;Ever since our election win liberals on social media have been confused as to how and why minority voters would vote for Trump. In my opinion it's probably because the American Dream their families immigrated to legally no longer exists, while at the same time we accept illegal immigrants who potentially are here to cause violence. I've seen an influx of Liberal leaning voters continue to talk down on conservative minoritiy voters, attempt to isolate them, and ironically be the party calling for the deportations of minorities if they voted for Trump. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing?  I said in a previous post on this sub that I am proud to be a Latino American conservative with hopes of bringing back the American Dream my family immigrated here for away from poverty, gangs, and violence. But after this election and with the situation I noticed with liberal voters, I would be lying if I said it doesn't hurt my spirit one bit. Since the election I've had people I knew from my past call me out for voting for Trump. It doesn't help that I consider myself a furry as well (I know, you can call me out on that). I've been called a traitor and a disgrace by liberal leaning people.

1jm19iw;Conservative;WSJ: Trump Pardons Nikola Founder Trevor Milton;"Not sure what everyone else thinks of this one, but I'm really not a fan and it's just serving red meat to his critics. For abbreviated context, the dude is a scumbag fraudster who vastly exaggerated the financial health of his company for personal gain (sold a ton of stock when its valuation surpassed Ford's) through various schemes, including but not limited to showcasing their product by having an inoperable prototype [roll down a hill and saying it's ""fully functional"" in a promo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBCxCcICgtU)     Sentenced in 2022 to 4 years in prison but's conveniently been out on bond while appealing. Even more convenient? One of his defense lawyers is Pam Bondi's brother.   Posting [article](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/trump-pardons-nikola-founder-trevor-milton-948b1311?mod=hp_lead_pos8) text below as it's paywalled  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **Trump Pardons Nikola Founder Nikola Milton**  by Corrine Ramey & Ben Foldy  March 28, 2025  President Trump pardoned Nikola founder Trevor Milton, who had been convicted of fraud in federal court for what prosecutors said were his lies to investors about his zero-emissions trucks.  Milton said in a video posted to social media Thursday that he received a call from Trump, who spoke about “how much of an injustice this all was, done by the same offices that harassed and prosecuted him.”  “The greatest comeback story in America is about to happen,” added Milton. The White House on Friday confirmed that the pardon had been granted.   A federal jury in Manhattan convicted Milton in 2022 of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. During the trial, prosecutors portrayed Milton as a con man who duped investors, including in podcasts and on social media, about the company’s sales and the capabilities of its vehicles. In one instance, prosecutors said, he created a video of what appeared to be a truck driving normally—but it was really an inoperable prototype rolling down a hill.  Milton maintained his innocence and said he had acted in good faith, accusing prosecutors of cherry-picking his public statements to build their case.  He was sentenced to four years in prison but remained out on bond while he appealed his conviction.  Brad Bondi, a lawyer for Milton, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Brad Bondi is the brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi.  Campaign-finance records show that Milton and his wife donated more than $1.8 million to a Trump fundraising committee in October.  Milton, 42 years old, founded Nikola in his basement in 2015. He took it public in 2020 at a valuation of $3.3 billion. He resigned from the company later that year after a short seller's report alleged he made misrepresentations about the status of the company’s vehicles and the production of hydrogen fuel needed to run them.  Nikola, whose market value briefly eclipsed that of automaker Ford before the fraud case against Milton, filed for bankruptcy last month, as it struggled with high costs and its efforts to convince the trucking industry to abandon diesel engines.  Milton has sold roughly $400 million in stock in Nikola, which delisted its shares from the Nasdaq a few days ago. Two weeks ago, federal prosecutors asked the judge from Milton’s criminal case to order him to pay back nearly $661 million to shareholders.  The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Milton in federal court in July 2021, alleging he committed civil securities fraud. That case, which was on hold during the criminal proceedings, remains active, court records show. The SEC declined to comment.     Trump has issued a raft of pardons since taking office, and has pledged to crack down on what he has described as the weaponization of the justice system. Trump was twice indicted by the Justice Department after his first term and separately convicted of falsifying records in state court in New York. Both federal cases have been dismissed, and Trump is appealing the state conviction.  Earlier this week, Trump pardoned Devon Archer, the former Hunter Biden business partner who gave congressional testimony about their business dealings. Milton, Archer and Silk Road founder Ross Ulbritcht, whom Trump also pardoned, were all prosecuted by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan. The Justice Department has also asked a judge to drop a bribery case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was charged by the same office.";wsj trump pardons nikola founder trevor milton sure think fan serve red meat critic abbreviate context dude scumbag fraudster vastly exaggerate financial health company personal gain sell ton stock valuation surpass ford scheme include limit showcase product have inoperable prototype roll hill say fully functional promo ybcxccicgtu sentence year prison conveniently bond appeal convenient defense lawyer pam bondi brother post news trump pardon nikola founder trevor text paywalle trump pardons nikola founder nikola milton corrine ramey ben foldy march president trump pardon nikola founder trevor milton convict fraud federal court prosecutor say lie investor zero emission truck milton say video post social medium thursday receive trump speak injustice office harass prosecute great comeback story america happen add milton white house friday confirm pardon grant federal jury manhattan convict milton count security fraud count wire fraud trial prosecutor portray milton con man dupe investor include podcast social medium company sale capability vehicle instance prosecutor say create video appear truck drive normally inoperable prototype roll hill milton maintain innocence say act good faith accuse prosecutor cherry pick public statement build case sentence year prison remain bond appeal conviction brad bondi lawyer milton respond request comment brad bondi brother attorney general pam bondi campaign finance record milton wife donate million trump fundraising committee october milton year old found nikola basement take public valuation billion resign company later year short seller report allege misrepresentation status company vehicle production hydrogen fuel need run nikola market value briefly eclipse automaker ford fraud case milton file bankruptcy month struggle high cost effort convince trucking industry abandon diesel engine milton sell roughly million stock nikola delist share nasdaq day ago week ago federal prosecutor ask judge milton criminal case order pay nearly million shareholder securities exchange commission sue milton federal court july allege commit civil security fraud case hold criminal proceeding remain active court record sec decline comment trump issue raft pardon take office pledge crack describe weaponization justice system trump twice indict justice department term separately convict falsify record state court new york federal case dismiss trump appeal state conviction early week trump pardon devon archer hunter biden business partner give congressional testimony business dealing milton archer silk road founder ross ulbritcht trump pardon prosecute attorney office manhattan justice department ask judge drop bribery case new york city mayor eric adams charge office;bygonecenarion;3790;0.94;715;2025-03-28 17:59:26;Flaired Users Only;0

1jkt5et;Conservative;This election win for minorities as well.;With the Trump administration taking no breaks for dismantling DEI, dramaticly slowing down illegal boarder crossings, and working to improve America's industrial investments, I feel as if it needs to be said that this administration is serving to improve the safety and security of Americans whether it's financially, culturally, or from legit threats. Despite Democrats saying that Trump's immigration policies only serve to prioritize white Americans, we all saw that it's these policies that attracted minorities who have immigrated here legally. Possibly because immigrants that came here legally don't like the sight of Biden opening the border for illegal criminal gangs.   While Democrats continue to try and emotionally manipulate people into believing that deporting violent illegal gangs is unconstitutional and push for DEI practices, it's great to see the Democrats fall into obscurity because they chose to die in this hill. DEI especially has now been called out again after studies shown that DEI practices mostly benefit white people.   I've never been more proud of an administration quite like this one, and this is coming from me who was a former socialist Biden supporter a few years back. This new shift has made me proud of me being a Latino American minority. The gangs my family fled from in Mexico no longer pose a threat to my family here in the U.S. I'm a Latino Conservative furry (strange I know) who holds pride in my flair I asked for because I have never been more optimistic about America's future up until now.;election win minority trump administration take break dismantle dei dramaticly slow illegal boarder crossing work improve america industrial investment feel need say administration serve improve safety security americans financially culturally legit threat despite democrats say trump immigration policy serve prioritize white americans see policy attract minority immigrate legally possibly immigrant come legally like sight biden open border illegal criminal gang democrats continue try emotionally manipulate people believe deport violent illegal gang unconstitutional push dei practice great democrats fall obscurity choose die hill dei especially call study show dei practice benefit white people proud administration like come socialist biden supporter year new shift proud latino american minority gang family flee mexico long pose threat family latino conservative furry strange know hold pride flair ask optimistic america future;Choco_Cat777;73;0.68;33;2025-03-27 02:00:47;Flaired Users Only;0

1jkoajb;Conservative;Interesting comments from a Wall Street analyst regarding viewing Trump similarly to the new CEO of a troubled company.;"I was listening to a podcast from a Wall Street analyst today.  To be clear, he was not trying to be political.  But he did talk a bit about the Trump administration, and their goals, in a non-political way.       One thing he said that I thought was pretty good, and I'm paraphrasing...      ""The way you ought to view a Trump presidency is similar to how you'd view a company that has a lot of problems, and now, a new CEO has been hired.  When a new CEO takes over a troubled company, they are typically going to make changes and shake things up to get that company on a better path.  I think that's basically what Trump is trying to do for the country.      So when you have a new CEO, you don't look at their results in the first 2-3 months, or even over the first 6 months.  You have to wait at least a year before their policies kick in and we see the results, again, a year or more down the road.  The new CEO should not own what happens in less than a year, that's on the prior CEO, or in this case, the prior administration.  Once we look at the results a year or more into the future, then they may partially or entirely own those results.""      Again, I thought they were good comments, and in no way was this analyst trying to be political or partisan.";interesting comment wall street analyst view trump similarly new ceo troubled company listen podcast wall street analyst today clear try political talk bit trump administration goal non political way thing say think pretty good paraphrase way ought view trump presidency similar view company lot problem new ceo hire new ceo take troubled company typically go change shake thing company well path think basically trump try country new ceo look result month month wait year policy kick result year road new ceo happen year prior ceo case prior administration look result year future partially entirely result think good comment way analyst try political partisan;Stockjock1;41;0.74;9;2025-03-26 22:13:40;Flaired Users Only;0

(Full disclosure, I did ask AI to help with this question to ensure clarity and grammar)   I'm currently looking into situations where individuals have had their bank accounts frozen due to OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) sanctions, specifically related to issues proving their U.S. citizenship.  If you've recently experienced a bank account hold or freeze because your bank required you to verify your citizenship status—especially if you’re already a U.S. citizen—I’d greatly appreciate it if you could share your experience.  * How long was your account blocked? * What documents were required? * Were you provided with clear information on how to resolve the issue? * Was the issue resolved without further complications?

1jo5lcr;Liberal;Trump is like an abusive father;To me, the idea of Trump being an abusive father makes sense in a lot of ways. **Guy who thinks he knows what's best, does what he wants, and is emotionally/psychologically hurting the family.** The analogy can be shaped a few different ways, but the framework makes sense.  **Macro-Perspective**  The Judicial/Legislative branches are the wife and the American public are the kids. The marriage should be an equal partnership, but the father (Trump/Executive) has taken the reigns and the balance of power is off. The children could represent the split American populace. One child may be constantly protesting against the parent/trying to share their feelings but they are disregarded. While the other doesn't understand/view it as abuse, may excuse it and say things like: 'Blood is thicker than water' (Common in abusive households).  **Micro-Perspective**  The father can do no wrong since only he can lead the family. The wife won't stand her ground and the children can only plea. Anyone who resists the father is met with strong opposition and is not heard out. People who do oppose are met at every level. If you talk back you're met with criticism, ultimatums, and humiliation. If things get physical, one side is clearly stronger than the other. Meanwhile the children fight amongst each other.

We always align on our views for the most part. This weekend I decided to bring up how important I felt this election was for our future.   Not surprisingly to me, my family was not voting Conservative (despite the fact that we live in the bluest of blue areas). But they were planning to vote either green or NDP due to the “Liberal legacy”.  I had to show them Carney’s resume and that he’s actually more like a Ben Mulroney than a Justin Trudeau. I told them that while I agreed with them that those two parties would have taken my vote before the liberal leadership change, that now we had been given the rare opportunity to vote for a Progressive Conservative. Somebody left enough on social issues to satisfy the left, and some one fiscally responsible enough to satisfy the right, without swinging too much in either direction.   The “Liberal disdain” right now is keeping people from looking beyond the party label.   I told them I felt he was the unifying symbol we needed as Canadians right now and they agreed.   Have those conversations folks.

Meaning that they could elect basically whoever the hell they wanted.   The irony of this, is that for most of the history of the country, this has worked. Even Obama wanted to elect judges that, while progressive, basically stayed between the lines of the law.

1jdc0bx;Liberal;Are we experiencing an American whiplash?;Across American history it seems like whenever there’s a large movement to advance the rights of minorities, there’s usually a large regression to try and claw back those rights. Theres probably a term for it that I’m not aware of so I’ll call it whiplash for now.    America has rarely if ever lived up to her promise but there have been extraordinary efforts to get us where we’d like to be.   We had the end of slavery then reconstruction. After reconstruction came Jim Crow. Jim Crow was followed by the civil rights movement. Once the civil rights act was passed we saw the war on drugs/ramped up mass incarceration.   However, during mass incarceration we saw a sort of racial harmony begin and cultural progression. LGBTQ+ rights including the right to marry and an openness to immigration. This sort of culminated in a melting pot coalition electing Obama. Barry wasn’t a saint by any means but electing a black president twice was a pretty big deal.   Is all of what we are seeing today essentially stripping power from a largely progressive population and concentrating it with an autocrat a response to what seemed America naturally becoming a generally forward thinking society? ;experience american whiplash american history like large movement advance right minority usually large regression try claw right s probably term aware whiplash america rarely live promise extraordinary effort like end slavery reconstruction reconstruction come jim crow jim crow follow civil right movement civil right act pass see war drug ramp mass incarceration mass incarceration see sort racial harmony begin cultural progression right include right marry openness immigration sort culminate melting pot coalition elect obama barry saint mean elect black president twice pretty big deal see today essentially strip power largely progressive population concentrate autocrat response america naturally generally forward thinking society;Numerous_Fly_187;190;0.94;76;2025-03-17 12:58:03;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

I was like, this is very hypocritical of them. Republicans have forgotten is that Trump was a  celebrity before president in which he was elected into the office twice.   There was a reason why Trump was elected in the first place because he made many cameo appearances in movies and tv shows like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Home Alone 2, Sex in the City, the little rascals, and the Nanny. His name was literally plastered in pop culture in the 80s through the 2000s and he even got a Hollywood Star for it. The apprentice was the biggest factor into making Trump a successful business man, even though he is not.   So it was Trump's celebrity status and pop culture dominance that got him elected twice as president and republicans should not be hypocritical into telling celebrities that their political opinions don't matter because they elected a celebrity twice as president. ;republicans say celebrity political opinion forget trump celebrity elect president hear election republicans celebrity voice opinion politic opinion matter like hypocritical republicans forget trump celebrity president elect office twice reason trump elect place cameo appearance movie tv show like fresh prince bel air home sex city little rascal nanny literally plaster pop culture get hollywood star apprentice big factor make trump successful business man trump celebrity status pop culture dominance get elect twice president republicans hypocritical tell celebrity political opinion matter elect celebrity twice president;icey_sawg0034;219;0.97;30;2025-03-16 17:54:36;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

Trump is down -9 in net approval rating. People no longer trust Trump when it comes to the economy. And people are already upset with the Trump administration and town halls are packed with people enraged with what Trump has already done even in red districts.  I also expect the US to go into a recession due to Trump’s idiotic trade war, which would decimate Republican’s chances in the midterms. Economists are already raising concerns of a Trump caused recession. People will not be pleased with Trump when prices skyrocket due to Trump’s tariffs and people lose their jobs in the coming recession. Voters wanted Trump to fix the economy and it looks like he will make things so much worse.  I think the writing is on the wall that the Democrats will blow out the Republicans in the midterms.

This isn’t because he doesn't know what he is doing. It's all rather intentional, clearly.  At first I thought the economy thing was about being somewhat of a grift, so he and his billionaire friends can get richer. I think there is an element of that.  The gutting if the government, is obviously him tearing it down to get his loyalists in there.  But I saw a post on social media tonight that made it click for me. It could have been a doomday post of a worst case scenerio. But basically it said that he is intentionally tanking the country so that he can eventually declare a state of emergency, which is a doorway into dictatorship.  I pretty much know dictatorship is what he had in mind anyways since 2020 and that has been my fear through 2024 and the election, etc. But it didn't dawn on me that this is how he might do it, by tanking the country on purpose.

Right now republicans are on defense and republicans are horrible at being on defense. What’re you all doing about egg prices? Ehh get your own chickens. Measles outbreak is going on? The vaccine might actually be bad for you. Say what’s up with firing vets? Maybe they shouldn’t be employed right now.    Those are just a few examples. Closing the government puts republicans back on offense. The market is tanking because the democrats shut down the government. People are getting fired because democrats shut down the government. Are these things true? No but republicans messaging will make it so.   Also something Ryan Grimm pointed out which is what would democrats be holding out for? Firing Elon? Giving Congress explicit control of the purse? That won’t happen so we’d either have an indefinite shutdown or democrats would eventually cave.    Also whether the government is open or closed we’d continue to see unlawful slashing of the federal government by DOGE. So I guess I see why old Chuck is shutting it down. Do I love it? No but it keeps republicans on defense while getting new senate democrat leadership. ;case chuck chuck say vote government open actually get mad yesterday politic usually entertainment chuck get nearly hour right keep government open good democrat right republicans defense republicans horrible defense egg price ehh chicken measle outbreak go vaccine actually bad fire vet maybe employ right example close government put republicans offense market tank democrats shut government people get fire democrats shut government thing true republicans message ryan grimm point democrats hold fire elon give congress explicit control purse will happen indefinite shutdown democrat eventually cave government open close continue unlawful slashing federal government doge guess old chuck shut love keep republicans defense get new senate democrat leadership;Numerous_Fly_187;0;0.37;52;2025-03-14 21:27:13;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1jb4fje;Liberal;Voter Suppression and Voter Depression;One thing I wish more people understood is that election results can “shift to the right” without anyone moving to the right.  Imagine a small district with 10 voters: 7 Democrats and 3 Republicans. All 10 show up to vote, so the election result is: 70% D, 30% R  Next election cycle, one Democrat is the victim of voter suppression. They show up at their regular polling place on election day only to discover someone bumped them off the voter rolls. Now they can’t vote, because it’s too late to register. Another Democrat is the victim of voter depression. They were disappointed with the Democratic party, so they stayed home. The remaining 5 Democrats and 3 Republicans show up to vote how they always do, and the election result is: 62% D, 38% R  The next day, the news publishes a map with red arrows on it claiming voters “shifted rightward.” Democrats declare, “We need to move further to the right to win back those voters.” Ironically, this strategy risks pushing even more of their base into voter depression territory. You can find anecdotes of people switching parties, but it’s rare. More people switch between voting for their preferred party or staying home.  According to investigative journalist Greg Palast, voter suppression alone cost Kamala Harris 3,565,000 votes. She likely would have won both the popular vote and electoral college if not for voter suppression. I highly recommend the Greg Palast episode of [“Krystal Kyle & Friends” podcast](https://krystalkyleandfriends.substack.com/p/episode-214-audio-greg-palast) (interview starts at 31:00).;voter suppression voter depression thing wish people understand election result shift right move right imagine small district voter democrats republicans vote election result d r election cycle democrat victim voter suppression regular polling place election day discover bump voter roll vote late register democrat victim voter depression disappoint democratic party stay home remain democrats republicans vote election result d r day news publish map red arrow claim voter shift rightward democrats declare need right win voter ironically strategy risk push base voter depression territory find anecdote people switch party rare people switch voting preferred party stay home accord investigative journalist greg palast voter suppression cost kamala harris vote likely win popular vote electoral college voter suppression highly recommend greg palast episode krystal kyle friends p audio greg palast interview start;tinfoiltatty;16;0.75;7;2025-03-14 13:53:45;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

This isn’t some wild conspiracy theory—this is a clear, documented strategy that authoritarian regimes use to consolidate power. The Trump administration is financially and politically strangling California, and Newsom’s sudden shift is a direct result of that pressure.  # No, This Is Not About 2028. That Excuse Is Insulting.  Some people are saying, “Oh, he’s just moderating to appeal to voters for a presidential run in 2028.” That argument makes no sense.  * He’s already one of the most high-profile Democrats in the country. He doesn’t need to pander to conservatives—he’s not some unknown politician trying to build credibility. * A governor of California shifting right would never be believable to moderates or conservatives. No one is going to suddenly think, “Oh, Newsom is actually one of us now.” Conservatives hate California. They hate its policies, and they especially hate Newsom. * If he wanted to appeal to moderates, he wouldn’t be aligning with fascists like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. There’s a difference between appealing to swing voters and normalizing extremists who openly call for dismantling democracy. * His own base is turning against him. The people who would actually vote for him in a primary—progressives, labor unions, pro-democracy activists—are all pissed off. No serious politician planning a presidential run alienates their own base for some vague appeal to “moderates.” * And no, his ex-wife doesn’t mean anything. People love to say, “Oh, but Newsom was married to Kimberly Guilfoyle.” So what?  That was 20 years ago when politics weren't polarizing the country. She also wasn’t a raging MAGA lunatic back then. People change. Having an ex who became a fascist doesn’t mean you’re in on it. It’s just a lazy excuse to ignore the actual problem.  The idea that this is some genius political move makes zero sense. He wouldn’t tank his reputation among Democrats for an impossible play for conservatives who will never support him.  # The Trump Administration Is Actively Cutting Off Federal Support to California  This is where the real story is. While people are arguing about whether Newsom is strategizing for 2028, they’re missing the fact that Trump’s administration is financially and politically strangling California in real time.  * Wildfire aid was delayed and restricted. After the devastating wildfires, the Trump administration dragged its feet on approving FEMA relief for California while greenlighting disaster aid for Florida and Texas immediately. California had to fight for aid it was legally entitled to, while Republican-led states had no issues.    * Source: [apnews.com/article/trump-blocks-california-wildfire-aid](http://apnews.com/article/trump-blocks-california-wildfire-aid) * Federal jobs in California are being slashed disproportionately. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), run by Trump loyalists, is gutting federal positions, but California is taking the biggest hit. The IRS and Treasury layoffs are expected to eliminate thousands of California jobs, while other states are being impacted far less.    * Source: [reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-face-thursday-deadline-submit-mass-layoff-plans-2025-03-13](http://reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-face-thursday-deadline-submit-mass-layoff-plans-2025-03-13) * Trump has a history of weaponizing federal funding. This isn’t new. Trump has repeatedly punished blue states by withholding money, including:    * COVID relief funds that were slowed down for Democratic governors.    * Hurricane aid for Puerto Rico that was deliberately delayed while Florida got immediate help.    * Law enforcement funding threats against sanctuary cities.    * Source: [washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/28/trump-federal-funds-blue-states](http://washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/28/trump-federal-funds-blue-states)  # Newsom’s Shift Happened Overnight—Right After the Wildfire Aid Fight  * Before the fires, Newsom was loud, aggressive, and constantly attacking Trump. * As soon as California had to beg for FEMA funding, he suddenly changed his tone. * Instead of calling out Trump’s administration for dragging its feet, Newsom went quiet and started engaging with far-right figures like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. * And let’s not forget—before all this, Newsom was a staunch advocate for LGBTQ+ rights.    * In 2022, he made California a sanctuary state for trans youth, protecting them from legal action in states with anti-trans laws.    * In 2020, he signed a law allowing trans inmates to be housed according to their gender identity.    * In 2023, he enforced LGBTQ+ curriculum requirements in public schools.    * So why is he suddenly shaky on trans rights and sitting down with people who openly call trans people “groomers”? * That is not a coincidence.  # This Isn’t About Newsom—It’s About Trump and the Horror Show Happening Right Now  Newsom isn’t playing chess—he’s been put in check. And if we don’t figure out why, we’re going to watch him go from a supposed Democratic powerhouse to a neutered puppet right before our eyes. And worse? It won’t just be him. They will do this to every Democratic leader until there is no real opposition left.  People need to get their heads out of their asses. Again, I’m not some staunch advocate for Gavin Newsom, but the patterns are there. It’s lazy to just brush this off and say, “Oh, he’s just another corrupt politician.” That’s the same bullshit argument that led people to fall for Trump—acting like all politicians are the same, refusing to recognize nuance, and ignoring blatant power plays when they happen.  This isn’t some conspiracy theory. Everything I’ve laid out is just facts. You don’t have to like Newsom, but you do need to start paying attention. The federal government is actively weaponizing its power against a blue state governor, and people are out here acting like this is just some normal shift to the center. Wake up.  If you refuse to see the pattern here, then you’re part of the problem. Ignoring reality because it’s easier than thinking critically is how authoritarians win. This is bigger than Newsom—this is about whether Democrats even have a future or if every single one of them will be systematically broken, controlled, or erased.  This isn’t just politics as usual. This is how democracies die. And if you’re too busy nitpicking Newsom’s character to recognize the systematic dismantling of opposition happening in real time, then congratulations—you’re exactly the kind of passive, disengaged voter that lets fascism take over.  # This is not a drill.

1ja7dxx;Liberal;Who are the Democrats going to run for office in 2028?;Hi everyone,  I’m from the UK and have a keen interest in U.S. politics, particularly regarding who the Democrats might run for office in 2028.  I believe the MAGA movement is here to stay, and there’s a strong possibility they could win again. With that in mind, who do you think the Democrats could put forward that would have a viable chance of defeating MAGA?  Additionally, what changes do you think the Democrats need to make to regain power and connect more effectively with voters?  As a concerned observer, I can’t help but feel that the MAGA movement is sowing the seeds for a Fourth Reich.

1ja5eqr;Liberal;Why do conservatives care so much about stuff that never affect them?;I want to say I am a liberal and will always be but one thing I never get about conservatives is the need to control people. For example the right to bodily autonomy where it comes to abortion they think they have the right to say what they can do with a woman's body. As well as when it comes to marriage they try to slam down gay marriage but why does two dudes they never met and likely never will mater if it isn't affecting them. And then thier is gender affirmative surgery on minors as a trans woman I will say I think the parents and the child deserve the rights to this issue but they are trying to control people's bodies on this as well.   And then one thing I get as a trans woman from them is just saying your still a man and I dont accept you etc. And I am like why do you feel the need to state your oppion and or why would I care what you think. And who said I need your accepts etc.   ;conservative care stuff affect want liberal thing conservative need control people example right bodily autonomy come abortion think right woman body come marriage try slam gay marriage dude meet likely mater affect thi gender affirmative surgery minor trans woman think parent child deserve right issue try control people body thing trans woman say man not accept etc like feel need state oppion care think say need accept etc;RecentMonk1082;278;0.92;134;2025-03-13 06:03:16;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1j9j1pq;Liberal;The conservatives can use social media better then the liberals?;Hello I heard this thing going around but I think the conservatives can use social media better then liberals can. I think a big reason why trump won in the 2024 election is because he was able to use social media better then haris could. I feel that Trump was able to use it to get the youth Gen z as a result. After all he did talk to Logan Paul and a few others to what a gen z man might be listening to. Harris didn't do any of this I feel that even when something is necessarily true conservatives can lie better to people on social media and still get away with it. For example during Trump state of the union speech he referred to as mice being transgender when he mixed up the word for something else and yet he was able to lie and make it seem factual and his voters ate it up. Trump also talked about do to how great his tarrifs are Honda was opening a plant In the U.S and opening up jobs but the company already said the plant exist and they are not hiring. What amazes me honestly is that conservatives can lie better in the media and soical media and get thier voters to still belive it.   For example look at reddit thier are more conservatives here then thier are liberals. I think conservatives have a bigger soical media preference. I think conservatives do it better at using social media to spread the word. This is why I feel liberals need to improve to use social media better..;conservative use social medium well liberal hello hear thing go think conservative use social medium well liberal think big reason trump win election able use social medium well haris feel trump able use youth gen z result talk logan paul gen z man listen harris feel necessarily true conservative lie well people social medium away example trump state union speech refer mouse transgender mix word able lie factual voter eat trump talk great tarrif honda open plant open job company say plant exist hire amaze honestly conservative lie well medium soical medium thi voter belive example look reddit thi conservative thier liberal think conservative big soical medium preference think conservative well social medium spread word feel liberal need improve use social medium well;RecentMonk1082;0;0.46;45;2025-03-12 12:36:19;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1j9bk3f;Liberal;A Letter I Sent to My Senator Tonight;Dear Senator,  I am a voting, taxpaying, citizen who voted for you in 2020 and hopes to vote for you again in 2026. I'm writing to say that I would support you if your decision was to vote no on the continuing resolution passed today by the house. For too long Democrats have held the high ground to the detriment of our political aims, and, as a result, the country as a whole. You are fully aware that if the positions were reversed Democrats would be unable to flip even one Republican vote, and I no longer believe Democrats should behave any differently. This is the first piece of political leverage Democrats have had in recent memory, and the thought that we are going to let it pass by in the name of decorum makes me angrier than the thought of a shut down. They want to eliminate all federal government jobs, let's show them what that truly looks like. They want to cut funding to entitlement programs, let's show them what that truly looks like. They want to rule with zero opposition, let's show them what opposition truly looks like.   There are so many things for which we could be fighting. Realistic policy initiatives that could be brought to the table by exercising what little political power we currently hold. We could be asking once and for all for Elon Musk to be completely divested from governmental affairs. We could be asking for full funding to be appropriated to Medicare in the coming budget. We could be asking for a complete, and final, resolution to the asinine trade war that only serves to harm average Americans. If we let this opportunity pass with zero concessions on their end in the names of decorum, decency, and precedent we the people will know that Democrats are complicit. No Democrat that votes yes on this CR without first ensuring some measure of Democratic political victory will have my vote in future elections. Regardless of how deplorable the opposition is, I would rather not vote than vote for someone who will not represent my interests when times are hard, because I will know that either way my vote didn't make material change.   I apologize for the harsh language, I don't enjoy being in this position any more than you do, but we collectively have a decision to make and we finally have the power to make it count. This is my small way of giving you the political will to follow through.;letter send senator tonight dear senator voting taxpaying citizen vote hope vote write support decision vote continue resolution pass today house long democrats hold high ground detriment political aim result country fully aware position reverse democrats unable flip republican vote long believe democrats behave differently piece political leverage democrats recent memory thought go let pass decorum make angry thought shut want eliminate federal government job let truly look like want cut funding entitlement program let truly look like want rule zero opposition let opposition truly look like thing fight realistic policy initiative bring table exercise little political power currently hold ask elon musk completely divest governmental affair ask funding appropriate medicare come budget ask complete final resolution asinine trade war serve harm average americans let opportunity pass zero concession end name decorum decency precedent people know democrats complicit democrat vote yes cr ensure measure democratic political victory vote future election regardless deplorable opposition vote vote represent interest time hard know way vote material change apologize harsh language enjoy position collectively decision finally power count small way give political follow;N0_PR0BLEM;32;0.83;9;2025-03-12 04:57:12;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0
1j9ajs7;Liberal;Do you think Gretchen Whitmer would be a good Presidential candidate for 2028?;I know it’s a bit early to make such assessments, but personally I think Governor Gretchen Whitmer would be a good candidate for the 2028 Presidential Election. Unlike someone like Gavin Newsom, she’s from Michigan, which is a swing state, and therefore wouldn’t be viewed as a “coastal elite” or having “California values”, which would allow people from fly over states to relate with her more. She won both of her elections in 2018 and 2022 (a year Republicans were expected to perform strongly) by more than 10 points. And while she is moderate, she seems to have no problem working with both independents and progressives.  As for concerns whether to run another woman would be a good idea, it should be noted that Whitmer, unlike Clinton or Harris, would not run against Trump, who has unique attraction with people that defies polls and patterns, and that Democrats won’t be the incumbent party in 2028 like they were in 2016 and 2024. Also, seeing how people who vote for Trump don’t seem to come out and vote for people he supports, Trump’s successor is likely not going to attract all of his supporters.

1j6zj80;Liberal;South Africa;I’m losing my mind over Trump and Musk’s absolutely insane claims about South Africa.  They claim the South African government is passing “racist” laws to the white “ethnic minority”  Musk claims he’s not an Afrikaner and not a N@zi… but then pulls this shit.   Apartheid “ended” in the 1990s on paper, but South Africa is still heavily segregated and has extreme wealth/land disparities by race. Black South Africans have never had the opportunity to be equal to the white population (even though white people make up significantly less of the population numerically). The South African government is trying to help redistribute land for Black people, but since equality risks the superiority of white people it’s “racist” and “hateful,” and Elon Musk had suchhhh an issue with it. So now Trump follows along and cuts funding to Africa, and offers expedited citizenship to these well-off white farmers who supposedly need so much help.   It’s so stupid and racist and shows that Trump’s administration directly supports white supremacy and believes the lingering consequences of apartheid should be upheld.  ;south africa lose mind trump musk absolutely insane claim south africa claim south african government pass racist law white ethnic minority musk claim afrikaner pull shit apartheid end paper south africa heavily segregated extreme wealth land disparity race black south africans opportunity equal white population white people significantly population numerically south african government try help redistribute land black people equality risk superiority white people racist hateful elon musk suchhhh issue trump follow cut funding africa offer expedite citizenship white farmer supposedly need help stupid racist show trump administration directly support white supremacy believe linger consequence apartheid uphold;HoofmanBear;16;0.77;1;2025-03-09 04:21:23;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1j6hbyb;Liberal;Questions/Observations on the Democratic Party - from a humble Brit;Hi all, hopefully this is a suitable place for this as the Democrats subreddit doesn't allow text posts. General consensus over here (bar a few far-right nutjobs) is that Dems aren't doing enough to oppose Trump and the current administration, and I read a poll last week showing 64% of Americans thought they didn't have a strategy to do so/the strategy wasn't working.  Firstly, is this a fair criticism? I'll confess to tuning out from most US domestic news, but (bar Al Green) was pretty underwhelmed with Dems' response to the speech last week. Goes without saying that I'd be very happy to be wrong and be told they're doing more to turn the tide.  Secondly, thinking back to the 2019 general election here in the UK - the Labour Party's worst defeat since before WW2 at the hands of Boris Johnson (who Trump then said was the British equivalent of himself). COVID and Brexit both happened pretty much immediately after that election, which gave the new government a massive popularity boost to the point where they were hitting \~50% in polls which is pretty unheard of for any party here, making it very difficult to be an opposition party.  I think a huge part of why Labour were able to turn this around and win one of their biggest majorities ever last year was down to holding a leadership election almost immediately after the 2019 defeat (as is almost always the case when Labour/the Tories lose an election). When the Tories began to destroy themselves later on, we had a clear, stable alternative government, telling the public what they would do differently.  I get the argument that choosing a presidential nominee so close to the election makes them potentially harder to attack, and to have someone running for president this far out would contradict that. But could a solution to the Dems' leadership problems be to hold 2028 primaries as soon as possible (as we essentially do), let the winner appoint a 'shadow cabinet' of sorts, give them a platform each day to oppose the current administration and put forward a different vision? Surely it would be easier for the next Democratic candidate for president to get substantial media coverage, which seems to be a big part of the problem, than Jeffries/Schumer/anyone currently?

She said in general Republicans do this and democrats don't. So we should do it more. Makes sense to me  I downloaded the ""5 calls"" app and gave it a try for about a week. I have some thoughts and questions and was hoping this community could help me get/stay motivated.  It takes less time than i thought it would, but it's still a pain and I want to make sure my effort is useful. I have no expectations that I'll have some crazy speech that changes his mind or something (like a movie), but I want to make sure there is a potential for a tiny long term cumulative effect.   I live in Texas. My senators suck (my representative is just as bad also). What effect could my calls possibly have? I've seen people say an aid will basically take all of the calls, make some tallies and tell the senator how the people feel about a topic. But then what? How could this affect ted cruz? How could it affect anything?   Like, for instance, I'm a teacher so I was calling about what's going on in the dept of education. But it's hard to imagine cruz going against doge and Trump on that (or anything). What is the point? How could this help?   I was thinking about the mirror of this, AOC said Republicans voters called her a ton. Did that do anything? Was there any way that wasn't a waste of their time?   Sorry if this seems defensive or defeatist, I really do hope someone has a good answer to this question. I want to do this every day, but I want something to hold on to so I can keep myself motivated. How do I think about this so I feel good about spending my time on it rather than feeling like I'm wasting my time?   A few questions about specifics  1. Is it okay to call multiple days in a row and pretty much say the same thing?   2. Is it okay to leave essentially the same message at the DC office and the local office?   3. Is it okay to leave messages? I saw some people taking about speaking with the right staffer, but I really only have time after my kids fall asleep and so I'm just leaving messages  4. Why do we call both the DC office and the local office?   5. Why don't I call the local office for my representative too? why isn't it 6 calls?

1j0xms8;Liberal;Am I even leftist anymore?;"So, for context, I'm not American, so it could be possible that the difference here is one of geography or background, but last night, I was watching a livestream of a couple of guys who I started following due to their coverage of the red-shift over at TYT.  Towards the end of the stream, one of them flipped out at one of the superchats in which this host went on a tirade about how Zelenskyy is a dictator because he has cancelled elections. When the superchat dude responded that the country is at war, the host responded, ""We are at war, but you don't see us cancelling elections!""  Now, despite my not understanding who American is actively at war with (perhaps he misspoke or I misheard and he said ""were"" not ""are"" and he was referring to Afghanistan), I still don't see how this is the same. The last time America had a war within its borders was the Civil War, and Americans weren't fleeing their country (correct me if I am wrong here). On the other hand, large swaths of Ukrainian citizens have taken refuge outside of the country’s borders so, in my view, free and fair elections are not possible until Ukraine is free of Russian aggression.  I unsubcribed from the channel because it made me angry, especially after the fiasco (not the word I want to use) that took place in the Oval Office.  So, my question is this: Because I support Zelenskyy and Ukraine, have I red-shifted without realising it? Am I no longer aligned with Leftist thinking?

Why did the world deserve to be punished with climate change and fascism?  If you care about genocide so much, then wtf did you condemn Ukraine and lgtbq people to it?  Why did you punish freaking gza?  If you are truly an activist and part of the left, you would have settled on Harris. She wasn't perfect, but no true left leaning person would think Trump was an acceptable alternative.  Now progressivism is dead thanks to you .  And you need to take responsibility for your actions instead of blaming the Democrats. You could've stopped it November. You CHOSE not to.    We begged and begged and you called us ""blue maga"" and said it was just a ""hypothetical"" , and ""fear mongering"". What do you have to say now?     Protecting democracy and civil rights should have been enough to earn your votes. If it wasn't then you were never part of the left.  The hilarious part of this is how they keep going back and forth on whether their vote made an impact or not.  ""Dems should've listened to us"" some of them say. ok then my point stands that you chose this , not the Democrats.  Others say ""our protest vote didn't impact anything"", oh so then we should have had focused on the center swing voters instead of listening to the left .  They simply can't make up their minds.  Edit:  You want to talk about war criminals? Where were the condemnations against Hmas? Why did they cheer them using civilians as shields instead of demanding they end the war? You can't accuse Democrats of supporting war criminals, while you yourself support them .  So no, I don't have sympathy for those who decided not to vote because of it.

They should be quiet killings, carried out in conference rooms and legislative committees - not on Meet the Press.   The American people will adjust to change as it happens. Just like they did with interracial marriage, gay marriage, women in boardrooms, black millionaires, and gays in the military.   People will accept change. But they will reject it if given the chance. They fear the unknown or the different. Fighting against that is fighting against human nature.   If change **just happens**... they take a beat, take a breath,  and move on.    But if you force it down their throat ***AND THEN*** ask for their vote to support it too... they will send us packing.

1iwdswz;Liberal;What we should be hearing from leadership right now, and how we should be rallying the troops;"'My fellow Americans, I'm going to cut right to the chase, as it's become abundantly clear to all of us that Trump lied about what he was going to do once elected, and now our very way of life is under attack.  Trump, in his first month in office, has submitted plans to destroy government services that serve to protect public health, food safety, and NATIONAL SECURITY. He is also planning on raising taxes on anyone who makes less than 300,000 dollars a year and cutting them for the very rich above that. He is raising the cost of life-saving drugs directly, and could put an additional massive tax on the working class through his totally idiotic trade war/tariff agenda.  We must fight this. And to do this, we have to stand together. We have to lay down our labels of democrat and republican and realize that this is a war on the working people and the retired and disabled being waged by the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, and President Trump and his other billionaire buddies.   The first step we must take is to forgive each other. We have to look at our friends and neighbors who we have argued with over other issues, and forgive them for anything they may have said when defending their positions and apologize for what we've said or done defending ours. Because the way the wealthy kill the working class is by keeping us fighting each other over other issues while they loot our government and find ways to squeeze more money out of working people.   We have to stand together, as one nation, one people as our grandfathers did against the Nazis, as our forefathers did against the king of England. One of the most potent lines in Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the USA"" is ""and I'd gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today"". It doesn't specify standing up with your fellow Democrat or Republican. It doesn't say about being woke or blue collar or nationalist. It says next to YOU, meaning anyone in this country who loves America and would not see it destroyed. We are at that point, and we must stand shoulder to shoulder.  So, my fellow Americans, let's forgive those we've fought in our personal lives, unite together to ensure our voice is strong and loud, and let's focus on what is most important right now, stopping Donald Trump and Elon Musk from stealing our money, destroying social security, Medicare and Medicaid, and from raising our taxes up to 2-3k per year while the billionaires pay even less. The time to put aside our petty differences and fight together for the working man has come, and we'll need every soul we can muster.   Please start in your communities, and work to make sure every person you elect or have elected is supporting the working class agenda, and if they are not, start with recalling those officials and electing new ones if your state or locality allows for it. Turn off the mainstream news, as they are fully owned tools of the rich that feed you information with the sole goal of making you mad at your neighbors and not the billionaires that own the news networks. There is very little time to save our way of life and stop this theft, and we have to be bold and united in how we approach it. We WILL stop the rich from destroying the rest of us, we WILL find the love for our neighbors, our countrymen and women again. We will overcome as America always has, and we will come out better than before. Thank you, and I'll see you on the battle lines!'  Some democrats are fighting, but Trump has lied to his own voters. Whether or not they ""should have known"" is irrelevant. We need to unite now, with any red-blooded American who wants a fair shot at life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It doesn't matter what happened before, only what happens going forward. We have to welcome EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. Who wants to fight this tyranny. It is the american way, and I hope some democrat somewhere can find the strength and the courage to take up this banner, whether pelosi and the other party leader LOSERS want them to or not. This is for survival, and we must win. Thanks for reading, and remember to practice mutual aide, plan for financial strain, and learn to protect your family yourself. Things will likely get worse before they get better. I love you all.

1iw4pj2;Liberal;"I feel Walz was onto something with ""weird"", he just didn't take it to it's full conclusion.";"I was watching Obama's funny angry translator video and something struck me when he made his ""old white people scared for no reason of Sharia Law"" joke (not the exact wording, I'm paraphrasing). Remembering, Walz's weird comment upsetting them so much, I realized that merely mocking them still gives them a sense of agency to troll the libs, but like a bully as soon as they are outcast as ""weird"" and socially unacceptable they back down (most of them would).  Their agency is removed, the ability to play as the anti-semites who will twist your words has been revoked all to simply since arguing against being weird would require articulating possible self-criticism and defending against it. For once, they can't ""debate bro"" their way out.  But Walz forgot one thing and it's his campaign manager's fault they didn't tack this on. He could've tacked on right-wing guru principles like Jordan Peterson's list:  1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back: Face aggression and defend yourself, taking on the burden of existence. 2. Treat yourself like someone who deserves your help: Overcome feelings of shame and unworthiness by caring for yourself. 3. Make friends with people who want the best for you: Surround yourself with supportive individuals who hold you accountable and praise your efforts. 4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today: Reflect on your priorities and strive for personal growth instead of being nihilistic. 5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them: Teach children right from wrong, avoid abusing authority, and make them competent in the face of challenges. 6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world: Assess your flaws, prepare for life’s tragedies, and focus on the good, beautiful, and true to make the world a better place. 7. Do what is meaningful, not what is expedient: Prioritize cooperation, delayed gratification, and finding meaning in the balance between chaos and order. 8.Tell the truth, or at least, don’t lie: Embrace self-compassion, admit flaws and mistakes, and create a livable reality through truthful speech. 9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t: Engage in conversations to learn and solve common problems, valuing the insights of others. 10. Be precise in your speech: Clearly articulate problems to confront and manage them effectively. 11. Leave children alone when they are skateboarding: Allow children to develop independence and competence by not overly protecting them. 12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street: Love and accept others despite their limitations, manage crises by compartmentalizing, and appreciate the small moments in life.  Could be made to:  1. ""It's weird that when conservatives shit themselves, they blame trans people a miles away for the smell.""  2. ""Weird, that you'd vote for a man who'd fuck your wife, if he could.""  3. ""It's weird, that you wouldn't want smart friends who could help you.""  4. ""Compare you to yourself before Donald Trump came on the scene, the difference is weird.""  5. ""Acting like a weird child that wants to adopt a random man and call them Daddy Trump.""  6. N/A  7. ""Are you acting weird cause it's easy, otherwise that effort could go to improving yourself.?""  8. ""If a liberal owns you, it'd be cringey to not give up.""  9.  ""Being a Fox News know-it-all is the weirdest thing you can do as a full-grown person.""  10. N/A  11. ""Will Daddy Trump let you skateboard today.""  12. N/A  I had to come up with something, but know someone else could do better. But the principle is that there ideas could be turned on them.

1it9uio;Liberal;Time for a General Strike; Democratic politicians and the media are paralyzed by the scale and audacity of Trump's actions and it will take weeks, months or years for lawsuits to crawl through the courts up to SCOTUS before they can be legally challenged. And we all know that that the corrupt  ultra-conservative super-majority on the court may very likely side with POTUS in it's power grab from the toady GOP Congress which is politically unwilling to fight for its constitutionally mandated responsibilities and powers. This is what MAGA and Project 2025 counted on!   In the meantime, we are quickly sliding into authoritarianism, and reversing all progress made over the  past 60 years in civil and women's rights, environmental protections, scientific and medical research, workers rights, healthcare and the social safety net, international political and economic stability, opposition to tyrants and dictators around the world, and most critically, killing American democracy. Around the world, people think that this country has gone mad, and rather than a democracy to be respected and emulated, we are now a country to be feared for its chauvinism, militaristic aggression and lack of respect for other sovereign nations.  Everyone who is outraged by the torrent of unconstitutional, illegal, immoral and downright stupid actions made daily by Trump and his defacto VP Musk,  along with every riffed or threatened federal employee, needs to hit the streets and shut the country down to peacefully demonstrate (unlike Jaunary 6ers) their resistance to this neo-fascist regime.

1iryz3a;Liberal;why do conservatives care about peoples business do more then liberals do?;I just want to say I was born into a liberal family. And my family are always democratic voters and even then I think I will always be liberal I don't see myself ever voting for a republican or conservative because I see no need to. I took a recently political test and found out I am more of a socialist democrat on the fact I care more about peoples rights then I do for anything else. Such as woman's rights to abortions etc. Yet I can never understand why conservatives feel the need to get into peoples business. When Biden  was president he passed the marriage equality act which the republicans barley agreed to which allowed same sex couples to marry. And yet somehow conservatives thought by passing this it was going to affect their right to marry when all it did was make it to where same sex couples could marry like straight ones. And then here I am thinking as a pan-sexual trans woman why do they care so much about who marries who I don't care who someone else's marries because I think its none of my business to care. I notice liberals work more with conservatives then conservatives work with liberals when conservatives introduce something they typically try to negation with them and or find a better replacement conservatives just want to stall and not offer any replacement whatsoever. As far as same sex couples go as well they always say marriage is meant to be by god or for some religious reason when legal marriage is just the state and county singing a piece of paper it has nothing to do with religion. And then I think if they want to get married in a religious way then get married in a church. And don't get me wrong I grew up in a catholic family and am still catholic but I think its dumb some of these conservatives use religion as a way of life they always assume the first amendment says freedom for religion but it can also be freedom against religion which means it says you have the right to be atheist. And so I don't understand conservatives thinking when it comes to political and social issues.;conservative care people business liberal want bear liberal family family democratic voter think liberal vote republican conservative need take recently political test find socialist democrat fact care people right woman right abortion etc understand conservative feel need people business biden president pass marriage equality act republicans barley agree allow sex couple marry conservative think pass go affect right marry sex couple marry like straight one think pan sexual trans woman care marry care marrie think business care notice liberal work conservative conservative work liberal conservative introduce typically try negation find well replacement conservative want stall offer replacement whatsoever far sex couple marriage mean god religious reason legal marriage state county singe piece paper religion think want marry religious way married church wrong grow catholic family catholic think dumb conservative use religion way life assume amendment say freedom religion freedom religion mean say right atheist understand conservative think come political social issue;RecentMonk1082;108;0.86;39;2025-02-18 00:00:32;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

AGs are suing, but the courts are too slow. Protests are happening, but the energy isn’t there.   Meanwhile, conservatives are brainwashing millions online, while we’re still stuck walking door to door like it’s 2008. Protesting is important, I’ll try to go tomorrow, but we need a complimentary online blitz.  **How can we flip the switch?**  Where is the energy of the tiktokers who trolled Trump by buying out his rally tickets?   What if we formed our own version of a bot farm, except with real humans, us, where we target specific posts or upvote certain comments. I’m dead serious. Is it right, is it ethical, who cares anymore? We could start a signal chat. Call ourselves DOGE - Disbanding Oligarchy Gaining Equality.  Billboards. Trolling Elon and Trump.   -A billboard of that picture Elon hates where he’s balding, and the line “this guy has access to your data.” I think Trump getting in bed with the other billionaire bros is a huge weak spot for maga and the weak link we need to exploit.   -A billboard of Bezos, Zuck, Musk and Trump that says “they get rich, you get screwed.”  I have the time. I have money to spend, but I can’t sponsor billboards on my own. I also don’t feel tech savvy enough to really tackle any of this without help.  Side note-  Democrat is becoming a dirty word. I have seen this on TikTok with many of our young adults not wanting to identify as democrat, even if they are left. They prefer leftist, which leads them to follow creators who spend more time attacking democrats than republicans.   I understand and share your critiques of the party, but every time you comment something like “the democrats have no balls” or “feels like we have no opposition party” it enforces apathy and suppresses turnout. YOU might still vote despite your frustration, but 50 people who read your comment may not. Plus it’s not exactly true. There are democrats everywhere fighting, I am proud of my senators in Oregon who fight daily. They don’t have TikTok, so are not seen like AOC.   Okay final thoughts.  Throughout history, small organized groups have changed the course of history, against overwhelming odds. Feels like people long to be part of something, a purpose, a resistance.

1iqk0my;Liberal;Is this a feasible way to get a moderate elected?;What I have discovered since the last election is that many moderates in American politics tend to be more Republican than Democrat, especially in today’s political climate. The problem is, we can’t get them past the primaries, because the MAGA ppl who make up the majority of the Republican party will get their extremist politician to win the primaries, and the Democrats are pretty much beyond help anyway. So I’m thinking, what if us moderate democrats defected to the Republican party in time for the primaries, outnumber the MAGAts, and get someone who would ACTUALLY be supported by the entire population to make it to the general election? Someone like Larry Hogan for example. I feel like it may be a pipe dream but I think it’s achievable nonetheless.;feasible way moderate elect discover election moderate american politic tend republican democrat especially today political climate problem past primary maga ppl majority republican party extremist politician win primary democrats pretty help think moderate democrats defect republican party time primary outnumber magats actually support entire population general election like larry hogan example feel like pipe dream think achievable nonetheless;Soft_Introduction437;0;0.15;2;2025-02-16 04:17:53;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1ipv3c6;Liberal;Something feels different about Trump…;Is Trump even in charge anymore? Or is he just the mascot while the real operators push their most extreme agenda?  Look at 2025—Trump barely shows up. When he does, he stumbles through speeches, loses his train of thought, and rambles incoherently. And sure, he’s always rambled, but this is different. Before, even when he was spewing nonsense, he had energy—this weird, chaotic showmanship that kept people engaged. Now, he just looks lost, like he’s struggling to keep up.  The people running the show— Elon Musk, JD Vance, Stephen Miller, the Heritage Foundation—are doing their most extreme, dystopian work because they know Trump’s base will go along with it. Trump isn’t thinking through policies or making decisions. He just signs whatever they put in front of him. The new MAGA leaders aren’t following him—they’re using him, waiting for him to fade so they can take over completely.  And something feels off about all of it. His rambling used to feel intentional, like he was riffing and playing to the crowd. Now, it just feels like he’s confused, meandering, and barely aware of what he’s saying. His movement is moving on without him, and he’s just along for the ride.  But it’s not just that he’s weaker—there’s a different vibe now. It feels more sinister. Yeah, he’s been through a lot with the courts and everything, but it also feels like he’s put people in charge who are really going to push that agenda, harder than he ever could. There’s just something missing, and I can’t quite put my finger on it. It feels almost like a weekend at Bernie’s situation — not Sanders…it’s a terrible 80s movie.;feel different trump trump charge anymore mascot real operator push extreme agenda look trump barely show stumble speech lose train thought ramble incoherently sure ramble different spew nonsense energy weird chaotic showmanship keep people engage look lost like struggle people run elon musk jd vance stephen miller heritage foundation extreme dystopian work know trump base trump think policy make decision sign new maga leader follow wait fade completely feel rambling feel intentional like riff play crowd feel like confused meandering barely aware say movement move ride weak different vibe feel sinister yeah lot court feel like people charge go push agenda hard missing finger feel like weekend bernie situation sander terrible movie;mistymiso;461;0.94;176;2025-02-15 06:02:36;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

And this fear was just blown up by conservatives to give the illusion that conservatives are trying to help women since the right is known to make up problems just so they can find solutions.

1ilklgp;Liberal;Ron Howard sums up this nicely.;"Lori Gallagher nailed this.   ***** ""I'm a liberal, but that doesn't mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let's break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I'm getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines:  1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.  2. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Somehow that's interpreted as ""I believe Obamacare is the end-all, be-all."" This is not the case. I'm fully aware that the ACA has problems, that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in, and that it's impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws, but I have yet to hear an argument against it that makes ""let people die because they can't afford healthcare"" a better alternative. I believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is, and that everyone should have access to it. And no, I'm not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen.  3. I believe education should be affordable. It doesn't necessarily have to be free (though it works in other countries so I'm mystified as to why it can't work in the US), but at the end of the day, there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five- or six-figure debt.  4. I don't believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who don't want to work. I have literally never encountered anyone who believes this. Ever. I just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death, freezing to death, or dying because they can't afford to go to the doctor. Fair wages, lower housing costs, universal healthcare, affordable education, and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this. Somehow believing that makes me a communist.  5. I don't throw around ""I'm willing to pay higher taxes"" lightly. If I'm suggesting something that involves paying more, well, it's because I'm fine with paying my share as long as it's actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while Americans die without healthcare.  6. I believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent, livable wage. Somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a Mercedes. What it actually means is that no one should have to work three full-time jobs just to keep their head above water. Restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips, multibillion-dollar companies should not have employees on food stamps, workers shouldn't have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet, and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live.  7. I am not anti-Christian. I have no desire to stop Christians from being Christians, to close churches, to ban the Bible, to forbid prayer in school, etc. (BTW, prayer in school is NOT illegal, *compulsory* prayer in school is - and should be - illegal). All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs. When I get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate Scripture into law, I'm not ""offended by Christianity"" -- I'm offended that you're trying to force me to live by your religion's rules. You know how you get really upset at the thought of Muslims imposing Sharia law on you? That's how I feel about Christians trying to impose biblical law on me. Be a Christian. Do your thing. Just don't force it on me or mine.  8. I don't believe LGBT people should have more rights than you. I just believe they should have the *same* rights as you.  9. I don't believe illegal immigrants should come to America and have the world at their feet, especially since THIS ISN'T WHAT THEY DO (spoiler: undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs they're supposed to be abusing, and if they're ""stealing"" your job it's because your employer is hiring illegally). I believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices (i.e., detaining children, splitting up families, ending DACA, etc).  10. I don't believe the government should regulate everything, but since greed is such a driving force in our country, we NEED regulations to prevent cut corners, environmental destruction, tainted food/water, unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment, etc. It's not that I want the government's hands in everything -- I just don't trust people trying to make money to ensure that their products/practices/etc. are actually SAFE. Is the government devoid of shadiness? Of course not. But with those regulations in place, consumers have recourse if they're harmed and companies are liable for medical bills, environmental cleanup, etc. Just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation.  11. I believe our current administration is fascist. Not because I dislike them or because I can’t get over an election, but because I've spent too many years reading and learning about the Third Reich to miss the similarities. Not because any administration I dislike must be Nazis, but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past.  12. I believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think, and desperately needs to be addressed. Which means those with privilege -- white, straight, male, economic, etc. -- need to start listening, even if you don't like what you're hearing, so we can start dismantling everything that's causing people to be marginalized.  13. I am not interested in coming after your blessed guns, nor is anyone serving in government. What I am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new, common sense gun regulations. Got another opinion? Put it on your page, not mine.  14. I believe in so-called political correctness. I prefer to think it’s social politeness. If I call you Chuck and you say you prefer to be called Charles I’ll call you Charles. It’s the polite thing to do. Not because everyone is a delicate snowflake, but because as Maya Angelou put it, when we know better, we do better. When someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurate/less hurtful than the one you're using, you now know better. So why not do better? How does it hurt you to NOT hurt another person?  15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs. There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe try investing in something else.  16. I believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human. They should be paid the same as men who do the same work, should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse. Why on earth shouldn’t they be?  I think that about covers it. Bottom line is that I'm a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn't mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don't believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved.""  ~ Lori Gallagher  I have edited this to site who it should be credited to.

It provides billions of dollars for the US economy, from $2bn a year to US farmers by purchasing surplus crops for food assistance, to hundreds of thousands of jobs, to grants to US non-profits and universities, and procuring medicine, healthcare supplies, IT equipment and other goods from US companies.  Lastly, USAID was established under the Foreign Affairs Act of 1961, and redesignated as an independent agency by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998. By law and the US constitution, only Congress can dissolve USAID (or any department/agency).

1il20ep;Liberal;Worry about schools using right wing curriculum;I recently wrote a strongly worded email to my child’s principal and district superintendent, and honestly anyone else that looked mildly important on the district website, about the “Indoctrination of K-12 schools” executive order and how worried I was for the changes in curriculum that it implies.   I got an accidental reply, someone in the district forwarded it to someone else and said it was a “form letter” but they should reply to me anyways. It actually isn’t a form letter but it got me thinking…maybe it could be! So here it is in case anyone else wants to edit it, send it to whoever will be most bothered.    To whom it may concern,  My name is ______ and I am a concerned parent within the _______ School District. I am deeply disturbed over the current president’s executive order for “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling”.  This executive order is in itself an appalling and overzealous attempt to indoctrinate my child and the children of our community into believing a singular and all together false account of our national history.  I am writing to you today to specifically talk about Section 3 B.   “(viii)  “the United States is fundamentally racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory.  And the following Section D: “Patriotic education” means a presentation of the history of America grounded in:  (i)    an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles,  (ii)   a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history,  (iii)  the concept that commitment to America’s aspirations is beneficial and justified, and (iv)   the concept that celebration of America’s greatness and history is proper.”  I have the utmost trust in our college-educated, professionally trained and licensed teachers to display a developmentally appropriate yet accurate reflection of history throughout all grade levels. However, I am concerned for the ways that our school’s curriculum may be forced to change, either within this school year or the years following, to accommodate the aforementioned demands.  The federal government is trying to enforce by a law a subjective manner of tone. What exactly constitutes “accurate and ennobling” when considering the ways various marginalized citizens have fought to earn human rights in America?  Subverting the racial and sexist reality of our nation’s history erases our community members’ struggles, laying the groundwork for future discrimination, and creating an environment where the subjective tone of factual events can be punishable by law and funding.   I ask that you are transparent if and when ______ School and all schools within __________ School District are altering any policies or curriculum to accommodate the aforementioned and all additional sections of this executive order.

1ijzf9h;Liberal;What do you think? Afghanistan in 70s vs US today?;The transformation of Afghanistan in the 1970s into a conservative religious state and recent cultural shifts in the United States share some parallels in terms of societal responses to modernization, polarization, and the role of religion.  Similarities:  1. Backlash Against Modernization:     - In Afghanistan, rapid modernization efforts in the 20th century—such as women's education and secular reforms—provoked strong resistance from conservative rural populations, leading to a reversal toward religious conservatism.     - In the U.S., cultural debates over progressive policies (e.g., gender rights, education reforms) have fueled polarization, with some groups advocating for a return to traditional or religious values.   2. Urban-Rural Divide:     - Afghanistan experienced a widening gap between urban elites embracing modernization and rural communities adhering to traditional Islamic norms[2].     - Similarly, the U.S. has seen divisions between urban areas leaning progressive and rural regions favoring conservative ideologies.   3. Rise of Religious Conservatism:     - In Afghanistan, political instability and external interventions enabled the rise of Islamist movements like the Taliban, which imposed strict religious laws.     - In the U.S., there has been a resurgence of Christian nationalist rhetoric among certain political factions, emphasizing religion's role in governance.   4. Polarization and Reactionary Movements:     - In both contexts, societal polarization has led to reactionary movements opposing perceived threats to cultural or religious identity, whether through Islamization in Afghanistan or conservative pushes in the U.S.   While the specifics differ—Afghanistan's changes were shaped by war and foreign intervention—the underlying dynamics of resistance to rapid change and cultural divides are comparable.;think afghanistan vs today transformation afghanistan conservative religious state recent cultural shift united states share parallel term societal response modernization polarization role religion similarity backlash modernization afghanistan rapid modernization effort century woman education secular reform provoke strong resistance conservative rural population lead reversal religious conservatism cultural debate progressive policy gender right education reform fuel polarization group advocate return traditional religious value urban rural divide afghanistan experience widen gap urban elite embrace modernization rural community adhere traditional islamic similarly see division urban area lean progressive rural region favor conservative ideology rise religious conservatism afghanistan political instability external intervention enable rise islamist movement like taliban impose strict religious law resurgence christian nationalist rhetoric certain political faction emphasize religion role governance polarization reactionary movements context societal polarization lead reactionary movement oppose perceive threat cultural religious identity islamization afghanistan conservative push specific differ afghanistan change shape war foreign intervention underlie dynamic resistance rapid change cultural divide comparable;WeenFan4Life;22;0.77;21;2025-02-07 16:45:54;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0
1ijygug;Liberal;The Only Way To Break Through is to Connect What is Happening to programs Republics care about. USAID's Food for Peace was created by Title II of the 2018 Farm Bill. The food from this program comes from American Farmers. Here is a summary and Quotes from Republicans on the value of this program.;"If you are in a district that is represented by one of these Representatives, call and ask them why they are letting Elon Musk, an unelected private citizen, ***hurt American Farmers*** by Shutting Down USAID. Look below and remind them of their own words.       Even if your Representative is not listed, ask them why they are letting Elon Musk hurt American Famers by shutting down the USAID which funding is under the authority of Congress.  One of the most important statements from the Summary.  >**Several members expressed concern about the Administration's budget requests** to reduce or eliminate funding for programs that utilize U.S. agricultural commodities, ***fearing it would negatively impact American farmers***.  [https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/110307/text](https://www.congress.gov/event/116th-congress/house-event/110307/text)  This document is a transcript of a House Committee Hearing titled **""The Implementation of Farm Bill International Food Assistance and Development Programs""**. The hearing took place on December 10, 2019, before the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture of the House Committee on Agriculture.  The hearing focused on the implementation of the international food assistance and development programs authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill. Key topics and themes discussed during the hearing include:  * **The importance of international food assistance programs** in addressing humanitarian needs, enhancing national security, and promoting global stability and cooperation. * **The role of various programs** such as McGovern-Dole Food for Education, Food for Progress, and Food for Peace. These programs aim to provide food assistance, improve agricultural practices, and build capacity in developing countries. * **The collaboration between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)** in implementing these programs. Both agencies work with various partners, including non-governmental organizations and international organizations. * ***The emphasis on using U.S. agricultural commodities*** in food aid programs. Members of the subcommittee expressed concern that there may be a bias towards cash and vouchers, and wanted to ensure American farmers and their products are a key part of the programs. * **The importance of program oversight and accountability** to ensure that aid reaches the intended beneficiaries and is not misused. Monitoring methods include third-party monitoring, biometric registration, and feedback hotlines. * **The budget requests from the Administration** to consolidate international food assistance programs into a single account which would reduce funding for some programs. This proposed consolidation raised concerns among committee members who believe it would diminish the role of the USDA and potentially reduce the amount of U.S. commodities used in the food programs. * **The role of these programs in national security**, by increasing global stability, and cooperation. The programs also aim to promote international partnerships and mutually beneficial trading relationships.  The hearing included testimonies from Ken Isley, Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service at USDA, and Trey Hicks, Director of the Office of Food for Peace at USAID. Members of the Subcommittee asked questions and expressed their views on the implementation of these programs.  Several representatives expressed comments and concerns regarding farmers, American farmers, and farm families during the House Committee Hearing on ""The Implementation of Farm Bill International Food Assistance and Development Programs."" These comments emphasize the importance of supporting American agriculture through international food assistance programs.  Here are some of the key points made by the representatives:  * **Jim Costa (Democrat), Chairman of the Subcommittee,** stated that American farmers, ranchers, dairymen, and women are the ones who produce the food for these programs and ""nobody does it better than the American farmer"". He emphasized that providing support improves livelihoods and builds partnerships throughout the breadbasket of America. * ***David Rouzer (Republican)*****, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee,** highlighted the role of American farmers in producing the crops delivered through in-kind food aid. He stated that ""a bag of rice, wheat, flour, or any one of dozens of other products grown by U.S. farmers are powerful symbols of the productivity and generosity of America"". He also noted that food assistance and international agriculture development rely on partnerships with ""fine farm families"" and food processors in the United States. He stressed that U.S. farm products are ""the true backbone of the assistance the United States provides"" and that ""American agriculture in-kind assistance remains as the backbone for years to come"". * ***K. Michael Conaway (Republican)*****, a Representative in Congress from Texas,** stated that there is a ""strong partnership between USDA and USAID"" and a ""broad coalition of stakeholders both in the United States and internationally"". He expressed concern that there may be a bias in favor of cash and vouchers over in-kind food purchases and wanted to ensure that American farmers participate in these programs. He also noted that the American people support these programs in large part because they believe it is American-grown products that are being used. * **Collin C. Peterson (Democrat), a Representative in Congress from Minnesota,** noted that dry peas and lentils, which are a staple in international food assistance programs, had dropped significantly in price. He pointed out that this drop in price should have resulted in more purchases of these commodities, benefiting American farmers who produce them. * ***Roger W. Marshall (Republican)*****, a Representative in Congress from Kansas**, mentioned the history of the Food for Peace program, which was started by a Kansas farmer and later signed into legislation by President Eisenhower, also from Kansas. He also emphasized that it is important to him that the programs use agriculture products made in the U.S. * **Jim Hagedorn (passed away, but his words are important), a Representative in Congress from Minnesota,** stated that these programs ""demonstrate the wonderful system of agriculture that we have, the expertise and the technology and in ag land with our farmers' hard work and the work that is done by our agribusinesses puts us in a position not just to trade with other countries and help provide food, but to literally give it away in many instances here to help people all around the world."" He added, ""We are very much interested in you taking products from our farmers and sending them to other countries, and not necessarily distribute cash payments. We think that that is very important"". * **Don Bacon (Republican), a Representative in Congress from Nebraska,** stated that ""Nebraska is proud of being like the lead exporter for beef, and go up and down the line and agriculture is one of our nation's strengths and it is a source of our nation's power and prosperity. And I just tell you, our farmers and our agriculture sector in Nebraska are proud to help feed the world, and we prefer not handing a check. We like providing our surplus, which we have"". He also noted that American farmers are a ""force for good"".  In summary, the ***representatives from both sides of the aisle showed a strong interest in ensuring that American farmers and farm families benefit*** from international food assistance programs by selling their products and also through having the programs enhance the image of American agriculture globally. They expressed concerns about potential shifts away from in-kind aid and towards cash assistance, which they see as a threat to American agricultural producers.

1iidej4;Liberal;FOR THOSE OF YOU LOOKING TO TURN YOUR ANGER INTO ACTION…;Here’s some advice from a high-level staffer for a Senator. Re-posting from a friend of mine:   There are two things that we should be doing all the time right now, and they’re by far the most important things.   You should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.      1) The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have face-to-face time — if they have town halls, go to them. Go to their local offices. If you’re in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the “mobile offices” that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson’s website). When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.      2) But those in-person events don’t happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.      YOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY:   2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators & your 1 Representative.      The staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story — but even then it’s not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).      Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to. Every single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics. They’re also sorted by zip code and area code. She said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it’s a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it’s often closer to 11-1, and that’s recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven’t.      So, when you call:        A) When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you’re calling about (“Hi, I’d like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please”) — local offices won’t always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don’t, that’s ok — ask for that person’s name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone. Don’t leave a message (unless the office doesn’t pick up at all — then you can — but it’s better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).       Give them your zip code. They won’t always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they’ll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.           C) If you can make it personal, make it personal. “I voted for you in the last election and I’m worried/happy/whatever” or “I’m a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,” or “as a single mother” or “as a white, middle class woman,” or whatever.           D) Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don’t rattle off everything you’re concerned about — they’re figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn’t really matter — even if there’s not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It’s important that they just keep getting calls.           E) Be clear on what you want — “I’m disappointed that the Senator...” or “I want to thank the Senator for their vote on... “ or “I want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because... “ Don’t leave any ambiguity.           F) They may get to know your voice/get sick of you — it doesn’t matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they’re really sick of you, they’ll be gone in 6 weeks.      From experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don’t worry about it — there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these day). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.      Put the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P – Politician.) An example is McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc., which makes it really easy to click down the list each day.;look turn anger action advice high level staffer senator post friend thing time right far important thing bother online petition emailing good thing hear congressperson pay attention face face time town hall local office dc try find way event theirs mobile office staff hold periodically time locate congressperson website ask question lot push answer loud vocal present well person event happen day absolute important thing people day call call day dc office local office senators representative staffer clear sort online contact basically get immediately ignore letter pretty throw trash particularly strong emotional story worth time take craft letter call congresspeople pay attention single day senior staff senator report call topic day office dc local office exactly people say topic sort zip code area code say republican caller generally outnumber democrat caller particular issue single issue voter pay attention like gun control plan parenthood funding etc close recently push republican congressman fence vote republicans year republicans call democrats call dc office ask staff member charge call hi like speak staffer charge healthcare local office will specific one transfer person awesome ok ask person talk answer phone leave message office pick well talk staffer answer leave message specific staffer charge topic zip code will ask sure mark extra point live zip code traditionally vote want sure vote c personal personal vote election worry happy teacher appal betsy devos single mother white middle class woman d pick specific thing day focus rattle concern figure topic mark list focus day ideally vote take day matter vote come week important get call e clear want disappoint senator want thank senator vote want senator know voting way wrong decision state leave ambiguity f know voice sick matter people answer phone generally turn week sick go week experience election hate phone feel awkward lot people worry bunch script indivisible lot float day day call start feel lot natural number phone p politician example mccaskill mo politician mccaskill dc politician blunt mo etc make easy click list day;plasticpixels;88;0.89;34;2025-02-05 16:03:54;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1ihzfa8;Liberal;Re: Trump To Withdraw United States From UN Human Rights Council;"Please, I urge you to write to your senators and demand they pass preemptive protections against those who are being rounded up by ICE and sent who knows where. There is a far more nefarious plan at play here and we need to be on the offense. I have drafted a letter that I sent urging legislation to be past protecting migrants re: Lake Riley Act and the news that Trump is Withdrawing United States From UN Human Rights Council.      What was in the Laken Riley Act? WASHINGTON - President Trump signed his first piece of legislation into law, the Laken Riley Act. This law mandates the federal detention of illegal immigrants who are accused of theft, burglary, assaulting a law enforcement officer, and any crime that causes death or serious bodily injury.  Here is a template you can use to send to your Senators if you feel so inclined!   **\[Your Name\]**   \[Your Address\]   \[City, State, ZIP Code\]   \[Your Email\]   \[Your Phone Number\]   \[Date\]  **\[Recipient's Name\]**   \[Recipient’s Title\]   \[Office Address\]   \[City, State, ZIP Code\]  **Subject:** Urgent Action Needed to Prevent the Exploitation of Incarcerated Individuals in Medical Research & Protect Human Rights  Dear \[Senators Name\],  I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the potential exploitation of incarcerated individuals in experimental medical research, particularly as Neuralink, a company owned by Elon Musk, begins human trials for its controversial brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. Given Musk’s erratic behavior and Neuralink’s history of unethical animal testing, there is a real and urgent risk that prisoners—who are among the most vulnerable populations in the U.S.—could be coerced or incentivized into dangerous experiments with inadequate oversight and informed consent.  While existing regulations under the Common Rule (45 CFR 46 Subpart C) provide some restrictions on medical research involving prisoners, loopholes remain that allow private companies to:  * **Target incarcerated individuals** as test subjects, leveraging their lack of autonomy and limited access to legal representation. * **Use financial incentives or promises of better treatment** to pressure participation, making true informed consent questionable. * **Claim that participation is ""voluntary""** when, in reality, the prison environment inherently creates coercive conditions.  Given Neuralink’s troubling track record—including reports of animal suffering, rushed testing procedures, and serious safety concerns raised by the FDA—it is imperative that Congress acts now to prevent the exploitation of prisoners in experimental research that does not serve their direct medical interests.  # Additional Concern: Expansion of Guantánamo Bay Detention Facility  Furthermore, I am alarmed by recent reports that the administration plans to expand the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay to house up to 30,000 deported migrants as part of the Laken Riley Act and accompanying executive actions. This expansion raises significant human rights concerns, particularly regarding the potential for detainees to be subjected to experimental medical procedures without proper consent. The combination of an increased detained population and the initiation of human trials by companies like Neuralink heightens the risk of unethical practices.  # Escalating Threat: U.S. Withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council  In addition to these alarming developments, President Trump has announced the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and the cessation of funding for the UN agency aiding Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. [apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/05e1d57bbb41df38771d1ab69adb21a3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  The UNHRC serves as a critical global watchdog against human rights violations, including unethical medical experimentation, coercion, and abuse of vulnerable populations. This withdrawal diminishes international oversight and increases the risk of human rights abuses going unchecked.  The U.S. has a documented history of medical experimentation on prisoners—from the Tuskegee syphilis experiments to radiation testing on inmates. We must not allow billionaires and private corporations to revive these unethical practices under the guise of “innovation,” especially at a time when the U.S. is distancing itself from international human rights protections.  # Proposed Legislative Protections  I urge you to introduce or support new legislation that would:  * **Explicitly prohibit high-risk medical experiments on incarcerated individuals**, unless the research directly benefits their own health and well-being. * **Close loopholes** that allow private corporations to conduct research on prisoners under the guise of “voluntary” participation. * **Mandate strict third-party oversight and legal representation** for any study involving incarcerated individuals. * **Implement severe penalties** for companies found to be coercing or targeting prisoners for experimental trials. * **Ban private companies from lobbying** to weaken prisoner protections in medical research. * **Ensure the U.S. remains accountable to international human rights standards**, despite its withdrawal from the UNHRC.  This is not just a medical ethics issue—it is a human rights issue. I urge you to take immediate action to protect vulnerable individuals from corporate exploitation and prevent Neuralink—or any other private entity—from using prisoners as test subjects for unproven, high-risk medical procedures.  Thank you for your time, leadership, and commitment to justice. I look forward to your response.

1ihvdeu;Liberal;Pro-choice people clearly care more about the issue and are more passionate/enthusiastic about the issue.;Therefore, single issue voting on abortion benefits pro-choice people more than it benefits pro-life people.   A report by Gallup published in June of 2024 cited the following statistics.   - 54% of Americans are pro-choice.   This does not mean that 46% of Americans are pro-life, some people are not sure what they think or simply do not care much about the issue.   - 41% of Americans identify as pro-life.   That is a decrease from a decade prior.   - 40% of pro-choice voters say that they would not vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on abortion, compared to only 22% of pro-life voters.   Think about that, even if someone is pro-life, they might be willing to vote for a pro-choice candidate if the pro-choice candidate agrees with them (them being the pro-life voters) on a different issue. An opposite scenario (a pro-choice voter supporting a pro-life candidate due to agreement regarding a different issue) is statistically far less likely to happen.   https://news.gallup.com/poll/645836/record-share-electorate-pro-choice-voting.aspx   According to USA Today, a lot of Republicans are dropping their anti-abortion values (either turning pro-choice or just becoming more willing to compromise on it) and that is how Trump was able to win and how the Republicans were able to take control of both the Senate and the House. Donald Trump actually said that, if Congress tried to pass a nationwide abortion ban, he would veto it.   https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/11/18/trump-abortion-stance-republicans-pro-life/76208481007/   The above article by USA Today was written by an anti-abortion advocate, explaining why Trump’s reelection probably will not signify that the pro-life crowd is anywhere near ending abortion once and for all.   Opinion based assessments of current events should usually be taken with a grain of salt, because they can be tinted by wishful thinking. However, the aforementioned article by USA today was written by Dace Potas, an actual anti-abortion advocate. If Potas is going to skew the data because of wishful thinking, Potas would probably do so in such a way as to make the situation seem much better for the anti-abortion people or much worse for pro-choice people than is the case here in reality. It seems pretty unlikely that someone, who wants to end abortion, would skew the data to make it seem better for supporters of abortion rights or worse for opponents of abortion rights than is the case here in reality.    As a pro-choice person, I feel that this is good news. However, it makes me wonder what percent of the people in the anti-abortion crowd have really thought through the issue.   The pro-life position literally says, A fetus is a person, the fetus’ right to live takes precedent over a woman’s right to control what happens to her body and this issue is so important that the government has a duty to intervene and force a woman to remain pregnant.   If I believed that, I would not be willing to compromise on the issue.  ;pro choice people clearly care issue passionate enthusiastic issue single issue vote abortion benefit pro choice people benefit pro life people report gallup publish june cite follow statistic americans pro choice mean americans pro life people sure think simply care issue americans identify pro life decrease decade prior pro choice voter vote candidate disagree abortion compare pro life voter think pro life willing vote pro choice candidate pro choice candidate agree pro life voter different issue opposite scenario pro choice voter support pro life candidate agreement different issue statistically far likely happen accord usa today lot republicans drop anti abortion value turn pro choice willing compromise trump able win republicans able control senate house donald trump actually say congress try pass nationwide abortion ban veto article usa today write anti abortion advocate explain trump reelection probably signify pro life crowd near end abortion opinion base assessment current event usually take grain salt tint wishful thinking aforementioned article usa today write dace potas actual anti abortion advocate potas go skew datum wishful thinking potas probably way situation well anti abortion people bad pro choice people case reality pretty unlikely want end abortion skew datum well supporter abortion right bad opponent abortion right case reality pro choice person feel good news make wonder percent people anti abortion crowd think issue pro life position literally say fetus person fetus right live take precedent woman right control happen body issue important government duty intervene force woman remain pregnant believe willing compromise issue;bigelow6698;1;0.6;3;2025-02-04 23:06:23;:snoo_putback: Opinion;0
1ihvbih;Liberal;Trump is purging federal law enforcement so he can pull off his Reichstag fire.;"Thanks to their private texts and public pronouncements, we know that Trump and his lackeys have salivated for years over the prospect of ""Marshall Law."" We also know from Trump's inaction on J6, his ritual celebration of that day's violence, his vilification of the cops who defended the Capitol, and his pardons of cop-bludgeoning brownshirts that he is pro-coup. And we know from his campaign promises that he's chomping at the bit to sic the U.S. military on U.S. citizens. He just needs a pretext, and once again, his Proud Boys are ""standing by"" to provide it. The only thing stopping them is federal law enforcement, and Trump can remove this obstacle by purging agents with integrity who do their jobs.   ""The day after the fire, at Hitler's request, President Hindenburg signed the Reichstag Fire Decree into law,"" according to Wikipedia. The decree ""suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including habeas corpus, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, the right of free association and public assembly, and the secrecy of the post and telephone."" Which squares pretty well with Trump's wish list for America.   The Reichstag Fire Decree, Wikipedia continues, ""was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered friendly."" Trump has, of course, proposed doing just that to unfriendly ""fake news"" outlets.   ""Hitler, after having obtained his emergency powers, announced that it was the start of a wider communist effort to take over Germany,"" per Wikipedia. Sounds like the Deep State™ conspiracies of Trump's paranoid fantasies.   He already has his emergency powers. All he needs now is his emergency.

1ihoha2;Liberal;Will Trump really end democracy?;There seem to be quite a few people who believe that Trump will literally end democracy and that there will not be an election in 2028, because Trump will become dictator as Hitler did.   Here are my thoughts.   Even if Trump wants to become dictator (and if anyone would derive a sadistic joy from that it would be him) I still do not think that his attempt to become dictator would be successful.   A report by The Guardian explained why the Trump administration is pretty unlikely to end democracy ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/06/will-trump-destroy-us-democracy ). Victor Orban destroyed democracy in Hungary. That might make you think that Trump will do the same to America. However, the system is much more complex and rigid in The US. It is unbelievably difficult to amend the constitution, I doubt that such a process would happen in the course of the next four years. To see why and how I can be so sure of that, research how an amendment can be added to the US constitution. While Trump can, and will, attempt to weaken democracy, it is hard to say how successful such an attempt will be. Furthermore, He cannot cancel the 2028 election ( https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-cancel-2028-election-weaken-democracy/story?id=117807079 ). The CLC has a plan to fight for democracy during Trump’s second term ( https://campaignlegal.org/update/clcs-plan-fight-democracy-second-trump-era ).  ;trump end democracy people believe trump literally end democracy election trump dictator hitler thought trump want dictator derive sadistic joy think attempt dictator successful report guardian explain trump administration pretty unlikely end democracy victor orban destroy democracy hungary think trump america system complex rigid unbelievably difficult amend constitution doubt process happen course year sure research amendment add constitution trump attempt weaken democracy hard successful attempt furthermore cancel election clc plan fight democracy trump second term;bigelow6698;302;0.91;221;2025-02-04 18:22:56;:snoo_putback: Opinion;0

There are three special elections happening in April. Two in Florida, one in NY. If dems won all three, they would have control of the house. Even winning one seat to help close the gap would be a major success to stopping these bills being introduced.  What can you do to help?  If you know someone who is in these districts, make sure they know the date of the vote, and where to vote. Make sure they show up. With no incumbent to vote for and no trump on the ticket, there’s a good chance the hardcore MAGA voters will stay home. Those in the middle have started to see the path that MAGA is putting us on, and can be swayed to vote dem.  If you have the time, volunteer. My personal favorite nonprofit is Sister District, which has volunteers do postcard writing, text message trees, and phone banks to call voters in other districts to advocate for progressive candidates.  If you have the money, look into donating. I personally donated to Progressive Turnout Project, which focuses on getting dems out to vote in these challenging districts.

Refuse cooperation with unlawful federal directives – State agencies and law enforcement must decline participation in unconstitutional federal actions.  Launch a Blue-State Emergency Response – Democrat-led states must form a unified legal & financial coalition to resist federal overreach, including:  A joint legal defense fund to fight federal abuses.  State-level emergency protections for elections, democracy, and economic stability.  Prepare for emergency powers if necessary to protect residents from further harm.

1igst5f;Liberal;Building our alternate media empire, a necessary step;"I am a former print journalist, so I have seen the decline of both television and local media into partisan hackery.  Our local newspaper, which employed 250 people when I started in the 1990s, now has a handful of employees who cannot cover the community. Local television news is equally hamstrung.  At the national level, Fox News, podcasters, social media, and TikTok have replaced what used to be balanced nightly news coverage, newspapers, and print magazines. These sources have totally coopted what used to be the traditional media space and have been essential in Conservative viewpoints taking over the media landscape.  Some sources -- the Associated Press, Reuters, and several other traditional offerings -- still offer value, though I fear they are little read or consumed. In the public square, we have a few still-popular media spaces, however, most focus on delivering news comedically. The Daily Show still reigns supreme in this regard, though Jon Oliver gives it a run for its money just about any day. Colbert and some others still have their place, but they are mainly preaching to the choir. And as Jon Stewart's recent ""chill out dudes, it ain't fascism \*yet\*""  rant shows, they are all not always capable or trustworthy allies.  Therefore, for the left to succeed in delivering its message effectively, we must work to create the alternative media landscape Republicans and the Far Right have so effectively crafted. We are behind. Far, far, far, behind.

My wife and I are open and we have nothing to hide from anyone, we are who we are.

He started and ran with DEI being bad for business and operations. Then went along with immigrants are the Elephant in the room we have to take care of, which for him, he's going to have a forever war against immigration. What these, let's be honest, Whites don't know is that they're on the chopping block as well and aren't even aware of it. Trump's campaign is 100% run on the same ideals White Christian Nationalists have which is why he got their vote. The root of Anti-DEI is racism and Bigotry, they just get an easy pass for not having to say the real racist words.

1igpw5i;Liberal;Trump’s plan: make it harder for his opponents, but not necessarily easier for his supporters;Discussion:  During his tenure, Trump has aggressively pursued policies that hurt his opponents while primarily benefiting wealthy elites and corporations and leaving his rural, low-income, and working-class supporters behind. His tax cuts overwhelmingly favored the rich and large businesses, while providing little long-term relief for middle and low income Americans. His administration’s rollback of environmental protections benefited fossil fuel companies but led to increased pollution in rural and industrial areas, disproportionately harming working-class communities and POC. While he claimed to fight for American jobs, his trade wars hurt farmers and small businesses, many of whom supported him but suffered from lost markets and increased costs. His attacks on the Affordable Care Act and cuts to social programs disproportionately affected low-income voters, including many in the MAGA movement, who rely on Medicaid, food assistance, and disability benefits. Meanwhile, his deregulation of industries, opposition to minimum wage increases, and support for corporate interests have made it harder for working class Americans to earn a living wage. Overall, Trump’s policies have strengthened the wealth and power of corporations and the ultra-rich while leaving many of his most loyal supporters struggling with stagnant wages, rising healthcare costs, and worsening economic inequality.

They seem to miss the lessons history teaches us, which is that radical liberal action revitalizes a population. Ever since Clinton we’ve gotten the same message “focus on winning, don’t let us be divided.” But what that actually means is “submit to the moderate wing and stick with the status quo.” Now after the loss we took in the election, the moderates are trying to push us FARTHER right to the point where we are becoming Romney republicans. They think we lost because we ‘stood up‘ for trans people. When did we stand up for anything? I can’t remember Kamala or any of the democrats promising anything more than what they’ve promised every four years four the past two decades. And they wonder why people are apathetic and disinterested. The truth is people want something bold and energetic. We need to start pushing aggressively for progressive action like student loan relief, price limits on medicine, fair healthcare that doesn’t leave you on hold for ten hours, prosecuting police officers who murder black men in broad daylight, reforming prisons, ending the war on drugs, and actual radical change. If the moderates want party unity, they can come to us for a change.

1igl8pa;Liberal;The Republican party appears to be becoming less homophobic.;In 2020, the supreme court ruled that employment discrimination against gay people is unconstitutional. The reason behind this decision was as follows. If a man, who is in a relationship with another man, is subject to employment discrimination because he is in a relationship with a man, but a woman can be in a relationship with a man without facing any such discrimination, that is gender discrimination. Republican justices John Roberts and Neil Gorsuch (who were appointed by George W Bush and Donald Trump respectively) voted with the majority. Two Republican justices voted in favor of gay rights.   Open a US history textbook and you may notice a trend that has occurred over the past 150 years. There is a group of people (women, gay people, racial minorities, etc.) who do not enjoy the same rights and protections under the law as others. There is controversy there. The issue really is as simple as, one side of the debate says that this group should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else, the other side believes that that group of people should be treated as second class citizens. The latter group’s entire argument is it is good when X group does it but yucky when Y group does it. The controversy really is as simple as that. When this happens, usually, A few people to the left of the political spectrum speak up and advocate for this positive change, but it seems unlikely that this change will ever occur. Year after year, more and more people on the political left not only advocate for it but attend marches and hold protests. Eventually, pretty much everyone on the left supports giving equal rights to this marginalized group, and the right is deeply divided on whether or not these people should enjoy equal rights. Decades later, we have reached a point where the vast majority of people (barring a very small minority of people) agree that the right in question should be granted to all people. It is amazing to most of us that this was ever controversial.   Here are a few examples of what I mean.   When the constitution was first ratified, women could not vote. Around the late 19th and early 20th century, a small minority of people began to entertain the thought that maybe women should vote. Most people (even women themselves) believed otherwise. Some people worried that women were too emotional to vote. To that I say, who is to say that being emotional automatically means that any vote you cast will be misguided. Some people felt that every woman would just vote the same as her husband. Not only is there a fairly decent chance that at least some women (maybe even a lot of women) would not vote the same way as their husbands, this argument fails to consider that unmarried people might vote. The social custom where women and children were to be the first ones rescued in a disaster was created to fuel the idea that women do not need to vote, because men will always prioritise women’s interests when voting. To that I say, women could also prioritize men’s best interests when voting. After all, every man who has ever voted would not have been able to vote if his mother had not given him life. Besides, women bring a unique perspective that men are not capable of bringing and vice versa. Even if men prioritize women’s best interests when voting, there may be certain things these men did not consider that a woman may have been more likely to consider. When the 19th amendment was ratified, a lot of people were mad about it. Nowadays, the vast majority of people agree that women should be allowed to vote. In fact, it seems kind of surprising that anyone would ever be against letting women vote.   Throughout the first half of the 20th century, black where were oppressed by Jim Crow laws and other racist policies. In the supreme court case known as Plessey V Ferguson, it was ruled that, things that are for black people and things that are for white people could be separate, but they had to be equal. The problem of course is that a lot of the time, they where not equal. If you had one restaurant for whites and another for colored people, the bathrooms in the white restaurants would be cleaner, the cooks in the white restaurant would be more skilled and experienced, etc. Apparently, if a black man had just used the bathroom, there is something wrong with it. If a white man uses that same bathroom, the white man will become infected with the black man’s germs. My thought process is this. If we allow separate but equal, there is a chance that the equal part will not be enforced very diligently. Therefore, in order to justify your belief in separate but equal, you must explain what is wrong with allowing whites and colored people to eat at the same restaurant or sit next to one another on the bus. Whatever terrible thing it is that will happen to a white person who sits next to a black person on the bus, will that same bad thing happen to a white person who sits next to another white person on the bus? If you say no, how do you figure? Plessey V Ferguson was overturned in a case known as Brown V Board of Education. These days, most of us are amazed that anyone would think that a white person using the same public restroom as a black person is inherently harmful.   Fifty years ago, most Americans felt that gay people should not be allowed to marry and adopt. Now, pretty much everyone who considers themselves liberal, is in favor of extending full equal rights to homosexuals. The percentage of Republicans, who oppose gay rights, is becoming smaller by the year.   Fifty years from now, I am confident that those who oppose gay marriage will be seen the same way that people who oppose inter racial marriage are seen today. These people will still exist, but they will be a small minority of people and most of us will be amazed that anyone is or ever has been opposed to same sex marriage. After all, the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm. That is not to say that, just because a behavior has the potential to harm people, that it should necessarily be illegal. However, only if a behavior is potentially harmful should it be illegal. Any and all behaviors that do not have the potential to harm people should be legal. Therefore, laws stating that marriage licenses can only be issued to opposite sex couples and cannot be issued to same sex couples is fundamentally illogical for the same reason that it would be illogical to have a law prohibiting wearing a green shirt in public all the while it is totally legal to wear a red shirt in public. Anything (whether it be good, bad or neutral) that could happen as a result of wearing a green shirt in public, could also happen if you wear a red shirt in public. Therefore, if the situation and context is such that you are allowed to wear a red shirt in public, then you should be allowed to wear a green shirt in public. Similarly, anything (good, bad or neutral) that could happen if a same sex couple gets married, could also happen if a sterile heterosexual couple gets married. I added the qualifier that we are talking specifically about sterile heterosexual unions, because same sex unions are 100% sterile, while heterosexual unions do in fact carry with them the potential to create new life. If being sterile does not preclude you from marrying someone of the opposite sex and/or adopting a child, then same sex couples should also be allowed to marry and adopt.     ;republican party appear homophobic supreme court rule employment discrimination gay people unconstitutional reason decision follow man relationship man subject employment discrimination relationship man woman relationship man face discrimination gender discrimination republican justice john roberts neil gorsuch appoint george w bush donald trump respectively vote majority republican justice vote favor gay right open history textbook notice trend occur past year group people woman gay people racial minority etc enjoy right protection law controversy issue simple debate say group enjoy right opportunity believe group people treat second class citizen group entire argument good x group yucky y group controversy simple happen usually people left political spectrum speak advocate positive change unlikely change occur year year people political left advocate attend marche hold protest eventually pretty left support give equal right marginalized group right deeply divide people enjoy equal right decade later reach point vast majority people bar small minority people agree right question grant people amazing controversial example mean constitution ratify woman vote late early century small minority people begin entertain thought maybe woman vote people woman believe people worry woman emotional vote emotional automatically mean vote cast misguide people feel woman vote husband fairly decent chance woman maybe lot woman vote way husband argument fail consider unmarried people vote social custom woman child one rescue disaster create fuel idea woman need vote man prioritise woman interest vote woman prioritize man good interest vote man vote able vote mother give life woman bring unique perspective man capable bring vice versa man prioritize woman good interest vote certain thing man consider woman likely consider amendment ratify lot people mad nowadays vast majority people agree woman allow vote fact kind surprising let woman vote half century black oppress jim crow law racist policy supreme court case know plessey v ferguson rule thing black people thing white people separate equal problem course lot time equal restaurant white colored people bathroom white restaurant clean cook white restaurant skilled experienced etc apparently black man bathroom wrong white man use bathroom white man infect black man germ thought process allow separate equal chance equal enforce diligently order justify belief separate equal explain wrong allow white colored people eat restaurant sit bus terrible thing happen white person sit black person bus bad thing happen white person sit white person bus figure plessey v ferguson overturn case know brown v board education day amazed think white person public restroom black person inherently harmful year ago americans feel gay people allow marry adopt pretty consider liberal favor extend equal right homosexual percentage republicans oppose gay right small year year confident oppose gay marriage see way people oppose inter racial marriage see today people exist small minority people amazed oppose sex marriage purpose law protect people harm behavior potential harm people necessarily illegal behavior potentially harmful illegal behavior potential harm people legal law state marriage license issue opposite sex couple issue sex couple fundamentally illogical reason illogical law prohibit wear green shirt public totally legal wear red shirt public good bad neutral happen result wear green shirt public happen wear red shirt public situation context allow wear red shirt public allow wear green shirt public similarly good bad neutral happen sex couple get marry happen sterile heterosexual couple get marry add qualifi talk specifically sterile heterosexual union sex union sterile heterosexual union fact carry potential create new life sterile preclude marry opposite sex adopt child sex couple allow marry adopt;bigelow6698;0;0.42;12;2025-02-03 09:23:06;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1igczrl;Liberal;Taxpayers Are Getting Fleeced: Why Aren't Our Tax Dollars Treated Like Investments?;"**Why is it that when taxpayers fund billion-dollar corporations, we don’t get a single cent back, but when corporations make billions off our investment, they pay zero in taxes?**  **Why Aren’t Public Funds Treated as Investments?**  Every year, billions of taxpayer dollars are poured into private enterprises, massive corporate bailouts, infrastructure projects, pharmaceutical research, Hollywood film productions, and sports stadiums, the list goes on. The justification? ""Economic stimulation,"" ""job creation,"" or ""public benefit."" But here’s the problem: while the corporations receiving this funding reap enormous profits, taxpayers see little to no direct return on their investment. Most of the time, we're left footing the bill while public programs are struggling to keep afloat.  If the government is acting as an investor, then why isn’t the public receiving dividends, equity stakes, or proportional profits? Why is taxpayer money being handed out with zero expectation of financial returns?  This should not be a partisan issue. It’s not socialism, as I know many would call it, nor do I see it as radical. It’s basic investment logic. And yet, in every major taxpayer-funded venture, the public is consistently left holding the bill while corporations rake in billions.  **The Math Behind Social Security: An Avoidable Crisis**  What really sparked this topic for me was a discussion I was having with my wife about Social Security, one of the most glaring examples of our broken system. Right now, there is a cap on how much income is subject to Social Security tax ($176,100 in 2025). This means that someone earning $176,100 pays the exact same amount into Social Security as someone making $1 million, $10 million, or even $100 million.  Logically, if this cap were removed, high earners would contribute proportionally to their income, and Social Security's funding crisis would largely disappear. In fact, estimates suggest that simply taxing all income equally would extend Social Security's solvency for decades.  So why don’t we do it? Because those with the most political influence, high earners and corporations, have successfully lobbied to keep this system in place, ensuring that the burden falls disproportionately on middle- and lower-income workers.  Originally, Social Security was supposed to function more like a long-term investment fund rather than a pay-as-you-go system. The original design intended for it to accumulate funds and generate returns over time. Instead, the money was immediately spent on benefits, and as a result, we've been funding it through new contributions rather than investment growth.  Had we followed the originally intended formula, instead of having certain global investment firms with trillions of dollars in investment capital driving up inflation, we'd have Social Security invested in our economy, with that return ensuring future generations would be able to retire without worrying that they'll have to work until they're gone.  **Where Public Money Goes, and Who Profits**  The problem isn’t just Social Security. Taxpayer money is funneled into countless private enterprises with little to no accountability for returns. Here are just a few examples:  1. **Corporate Bailouts:** During the 2008 financial crisis, the government bailed out banks with $700 billion in taxpayer money. Those banks quickly recovered and became massively profitable again, but did the public receive a return on their forced investment? No. The banks pocketed the profits, paid out executive bonuses, and then raised fees on the customers who paid for their bailout. This doesn't even count the car company bailouts or any of the other numerous other companies saved by taxpayer money. 2. **Big Pharma and Government-Funded Research:** Many of the world’s most profitable drugs were developed using taxpayer-funded research. Once these drugs hit the market, pharmaceutical companies slap on astronomical price tags. The public, who funded the research, not only has to pay full price, but these companies often hike up prices on drugs they know that Medicare and Medicaid will pay for. Why aren’t these investments structured like venture capital deals, where the government retains a percentage of profits? You could probably fund Medicare with just fair dividends from the drugs taxpayers have paid to research. 3. **Hollywood and Publicly Funded Productions:** Millions of taxpayer dollars go into film tax credits, military-funded productions, and subsidized studio infrastructure. Yet when a film makes hundreds of millions in profit, does the government receive a percentage? Absolutely not. Imagine if taxpayers had a stake in every blockbuster they funded proportionate to the tax dollars used to produce the film. 4. **Stadium Construction:** A Perpetual Public Loss: Cities routinely shell out hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to build sports stadiums under the false promise of ""economic growth."" In reality, these projects generate mostly low-wage jobs with little tax revenue to justify the expense. Many of the employees at these stadiums make so little that they end up on Medicaid and food stamps, so I highly doubt even the few jobs they produce manage to create a positive tax flow. Meanwhile, team owners, often billionaires, profit immensely, and then a few decades later, demand new taxpayer-funded stadiums. Instead of this endless cycle, why aren’t cities demanding ownership stakes in these franchises? It would be a better benefit to taxpayers if these downtown stadiums were used to build parking lots instead. I'm not saying we shouldn't have sports teams, but if we're funding the stadiums, and they have enough money to sign enormous contracts with athletes (recently I saw one that was almost a billion dollars for one player), then why on earth is there not enough money to repay the cost of the stadium, at a bare minimum?  A Simple, Fair Solution: Treat Public Spending Like Investment Capital  If a venture capital firm invests in a startup, they get equity. If a bank loans money, they demand collateral. If the government (taxpayers) funds a project, why is there no expectation of a financial return?  **A fair public investment strategy would include:**  * **Profit Shares:** If public money funds 20% of a business, the public should receive 20% of its net profits. * **Stock Ownership:** If taxpayer dollars bail out a corporation, the government should receive equity. * **Dividends for Public Programs:** Profits from publicly funded projects should be reinvested into Social Security, Medicare, and public infrastructure, not funneled into executive bonuses.  I absolutely do not see this as government overreach, I see it as just common sense. Taxpayers should expect the same returns on investment that any private investor would demand. Taxpayer-funded programs have contributed greatly to the corporate side of the economy, why is it acceptable that our tax dollars become their paychecks while very few of them contribute anything in the way of taxes?  **Why This Hasn’t Happened, and How We Change It**  The only reason this system persists is because corporations have structured public spending to their advantage. Lobbyists ensure that taxpayer money keeps flowing with no strings attached, while politicians, many of whom engage in a form of legal insider trading, benefit directly from protecting corporate interests.  **But this conversation needs to happen. Americans deserve to ask:**  * Why are we funding billion-dollar corporations with no expectation of return? * Why do politicians resist removing the Social Security tax cap when it could fix the program's funding crisis? * Why are taxpayer-funded investments structured as giveaways instead of long-term public assets? * Why do we give money to corporations that don't pay taxes and are run by executives who also don't pay taxes when they give themselves the money we used to bail them out?  If we demand accountability in public spending, we could transform Social Security, fund public programs without increasing taxes, and finally break the cycle of corporate welfare disguised as economic policy.  It’s time to start treating public investment like what it actually is: **an investment.**  Let's face the truth, these corporations rarely pay taxes. There are so many tax loopholes out there that we dump billions of dollars into corporations that, at the end of the year, pay less taxes than the average employee at their own company.  Taking an equity stake in public investments is likely the only way taxpayers will ever see any return on public investment. It's important to recognize that we're in deficit spending, which means every dollar of corporate welfare is money we don't even have. Why do we allow our children and grandchildren to be born into debt, ensuring executives are guaranteed generations of wealth for theirs?  Personally, I'm sick of promises to tax the rich that, in the end, just end up creating inflation we pay for everywhere, from the pump to the grocery store. This is the only way I see corporations ever actually paying their fair share without it becoming just another expense that they will add their profit margins to and dump right back on us to pay for them.  How much of Wall Street has been funded by taxpayers, but only the wealthiest people and politicians make anything off it? Imagine if those companies had publicly appointed representatives on their boards, similar to how government-funded agencies operate!  How much of our infrastructure was taxpayer-funded, but corporations make all the money off it?  I'm sure many people can give countless more examples of taxpayer investments where the public saw no return.  Doesn't this seem like something that could be framed as a net positive for enough people on both sides of the aisle to make it happen (eventually)?

1ig954u;Liberal;Why Do Conservatives Hate America?;They’re broadly supporting policies that will ruin American companies, cost Americans their jobs, and force Americans to pay more for goods and services. They support attacking our allies and opening up avenues for China to replace us in the global trade system. For a group whose motto is “Make America Great Again”, why do they consistently support policies aimed at crippling United States?   Trump’s tariffs are the biggest tax on American consumers since the 1940’s. It will cost the average American at least $1,000 dollars per year in consumption taxes, without accounting for retaliatory effects. We are both reducing our food supply workforce via deportation (even of legal citizens) and taxing the food supply via tariffs. A double whammy on price increases and inflation. Not to mention, he randomly poured out a large portion of California’s water supply for quite literally no reason, depleting the water available for our farmers this summer for irrigation.   Canada is our countries biggest supplier of energy. We are taxing that, too. We are taxing CANADA more than CHINA, who is the best positioned country to supplant us in global trade with both Canada and the EU. We are releasing cop beaters back into society and providing an unelected, non-government official in Elon Musk (who has significant business with and in China) with our private citizen’s information on banking and addresses.  Trump has spent two weeks focused explicitly on crippling the American economy, reducing our access to goods and services, making the ones we do have access to more expensive, and ensuring that things only get much worse from here. Conservatives meanwhile are whining and crying about Democrats, DEI, and people wanting to keep their bills down. They are cheering on inflation, government control of your personal information, China, and weakening of national security. It’s truly baffling how much they are rooting against their own country. ;conservative hate america broadly support policy ruin american company cost americans job force americans pay good service support attack ally open avenue china replace global trade system group motto america great consistently support policy aim crippling united states trump tariff big tax american consumer cost average american dollar year consumption taxis account retaliatory effect reduce food supply workforce deportation legal citizen tax food supply tariff double whammy price increase inflation mention randomly pour large portion california water supply literally reason deplete water available farmer summer irrigation canada country big supplier energy tax tax canada china well position country supplant global trade canada eu release cop beater society provide unelected non government official elon musk significant business china private citizen information banking address trump spend week focus explicitly cripple american economy reduce access good service make one access expensive ensure thing bad conservative whine cry democrats dei people want bill cheer inflation government control personal information china weaken national security truly baffle root country;brewin91;476;0.9;142;2025-02-02 22:07:20;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1ifx5vu;Liberal;Trump Blames Immigrants for Housing Prices—But His Own Policies Fueled the Surge;These are my thoughts on Trumps impact on the housing market surge:  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 introduced a one-time mandatory repatriation tax on foreign earnings of U.S. corporations, leading to the repatriation of approximately $777 billion in 2018. This influx of capital resulted in significant share buybacks and dividend distributions, providing substantial windfalls for investors. Many reinvested these gains into investment real estate, fueling a buying frenzy that contributed to rapid property price increases. Additionally, the number of investment properties and Airbnb listings surged, further intensifying competition in the housing market.  During President Trump's tenure, the gross federal debt increased by about $7.8 trillion, rising from $19.95 trillion to $27.75 trillion.   [crfb.org](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-did-president-trump-add-debt?utm_source=chatgpt.com)This increase was due in part to the TCJA and subsequent fiscal policies, including COVID-19 relief measures.  Despite these factors, former President Trump has attributed the rise in housing market prices solely to increased immigration, overlooking the significant impact of policies enacted during his administration.   Trump’s millionaire and billionaire friends have expanded their real estate empires while the average American struggles to afford a home—if they can at all. Instead, we’re left renting from the 1%. And now, he claims he’ll ‘fix’ the crisis by separating families, framing himself as the savior of a problem his own policies helped create.  What are your thoughts?

1ifm4z2;Liberal;Rethink Protesting;Current protesting has limited impact and largely isn’t seen by those who need to see it the most.   So many times I’ve heard in rural communities that protesters are “destroying their own cities.” Or some variation of that.   50501 is planning on protesting in capitals, where they hope to be seen and heard by legislators I’m guessing.   ——  Some questions:  Cities remain largely liberal. Rural areas aren’t. What actual impact does protesting in a city have when the people there already largely agree?   What impact does protesting in front of a capital have when a lot of those legislators don’t have to go to work, aren’t voted in from that area, and just wait it out?   ——  I’m recommending a change of tactics.   Guerrilla protesting rural areas.  Why not? Conservative agitators often go to cities to cause issues. They aren’t always from those cities.  I get that it can be harder to organize but it’s not impossible.   Overwhelm smaller towns. Their police forces can’t handle it and jails aren’t built for it. Town cops from nearby towns don’t have jurisdiction.   The towns are often centralized where protest can be heard efficiently, and movement through the towns typically doesn’t take much time.   These are also the people that keep voting for this nonsense, so give them what they didn’t want….hearing your voice. ;rethink protesting current protest limited impact largely see need time hear rural community protester destroy city variation plan protest capital hope see hear legislator guess question city remain largely liberal rural area actual impact protest city people largely agree impact protest capital lot legislator work vote area wait recommend change tactic guerrilla protest rural area conservative agitator city cause issue city hard organize impossible overwhelm small town police force handle jail build town cop nearby town jurisdiction town centralize protest hear efficiently movement town typically time people vote nonsense voice;EducationMental648;5;0.61;5;2025-02-02 01:40:02;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

His claims that putting tariffs on Canadian oil will lower the price of gas because we will using our own, instead of buying theirs. Our refineries are setup to convert heavy dirty crude oil that we buy at a cheaper price. We sell our light sweet crude oil to other nation's that have refineries setup to convert light sweet crude into fuels. We buy cheaper crude oil and sell higher priced crude oil. It would take billions of dollars for the US to convert our refineries over to convert  from heavy crude to light crude. This issue should have been taken into consideration before he started messing with it. We will soon be paying a dollar or two more very soon for a gallon of gas. Plus we buy a lot of natural gas.

1ielqlf;Liberal;In Defense of Overreacting;People living in Germany in 1933 didn’t know they were living in *Germany 1933*. There weren’t flashing neon signs saying “Fascism is happening now.” According to The Anne Frank House’s brief history of [Germany from democracy to dictatorship](https://www.annefrank.org/en/anne-frank/go-in-depth/germany-1933-democracy-dictatorship/):  >When Hitler was named Chancellor “many Germans were indifferent to the news. They had seen many governments come and go and did not expect the new government to last any time at all.”  The first concentration camps (to hold political opponents) opened 2 months later. Germany was holding sham elections 8 months after that. **Fascism is like life. It comes at you fast.**  There have already been creepy parallels between the Trump team’s rhetoric/actions and those of early Nazi Germany. Is it overreacting to take those parallels seriously? Perhaps. But when it comes to potentially losing our democracy, I’d rather pull the fire alarm too early than too late.  If all goes well, we’ll look like we were overreacting. That's a risk I’m willing to take.;defense overreact people live germany know live germany flash neon sign say fascism happen accord anne frank house brief history germany democracy en anne frank depth democracy hitler name chancellor germans indifferent news see government come expect new government time concentration camp hold political opponent open month later germany hold sham election month fascism like life come fast creepy parallel trump team rhetoric action early nazi germany overreact parallel seriously come potentially lose democracy pull fire alarm early late go look like overreact risk willing;tinfoiltatty;74;0.95;19;2025-01-31 18:34:40;NA;0

And that is - turn Fox News off for a whole day. Just do it. Don't feed the beast.  This administration, lives, breathes, and thrives off of that wretched network. It's the highest rated news network in the country. Literally every right wing politician in the country contributes to it. The best way to stop a troll is to not give it any fuel for the fire. And a lot of their hosts do nothing but trash other talk shows and anything else that doesn't fit Murdoch's mold.   The simple fact of the matter is that Fox News is poison. It has rotted as many if not more minds than the most dangerous street drugs out there. Doesn't matter which of their obnoxious hosts -  if it's Hannity, Gutfeld, Ingraham, Baritromo, and so on, they're just trolls. They just feed and thrive off misery and chaos - particularly ours. And the people they promote and get elected are nothing more than glorified content creators for that channel. Hell, since taking office last Monday, Trump has been on that channel like 5 times in the last week. Vance has been on it almost every day. And everyone else connected to that administration is on it daily.  So the best way to starve a troll - don't give them any fuel for the fire. Turn off Fox. Just turn it off. If we could put a dent in their ratings, yeah it might not be much in the short run but hitting them repeatedly where it hurts could be a huge boost to our side in the long run. Turn off Fox - turn it off at gyms, turn it off at home, turn it off at restaurants, doctors offices, offices, everywhere. It's just a thought.

1ie4129;Liberal;My mom just lost her job because Elon and trump froze foreign aid funding;It’s not even widely covered yet because of all the other thousand things going on but they froze foreign aid funding. This is separate from the funding freeze that was reversed.  She works in global health and development. 2ish days ago they froze all foreign aid funding for an audit. Audits are normal but freezing it in the meantime is not. Not only that, they froze funding that was already allocated/promised. Nonprofits will spend that money on credit as soon as it’s allocated meaning several are already folding and declaring bankruptcy. Almost everyone she knows in the field have been laid off or put on leave. They’re freaking the fuck out as now the entire industry they work in is faltering and there’s no way to find a new job until this is resolved (if it’s resolved).  Luckily my parents are moving to London for a few years in the next month and she’ll be able to get a job there that’s not affected by the US government but this freeze means employees in other countries—many of whom are the breadwinners for their families—are abruptly out of work.  American workers who are abroad are being called home immediately and my mom told me there are shipments of essential goods en route now (including HIV medications) that now have no one to even receive them. Not to mention many people will soon be left without HIV meds they rely on NGOs to provide which could increase the spread and potentially cause severe illness and death. There are exceptions but they’re so murky and ill defined that no organization can figure out how to navigate them.  I’ve tried to stay optimistic but within less than a month this president and his weird sidekick have already cost my mom and thousands of others their jobs not to mention jeopardized the lives and safety of god knows how many people abroad.

It could happen someday that Trump steps down due to age or he gets removed from office for being mentally unfit. From your point of view would you prefer Trump to stay or Vance to take over?  I'm aware there are two schools of thought here. Some want the republicans to run the country well, others want them to do a poor job so they aren't voted in next time.  Trump has the extremely strong following but a tendency to do what he wants including doing and saying damaging things that alienate his team and sometimes even voters. But he doesn't seem to care too much about Project 2025.  Vance is more competent and seems more closely aligned with Project 2025 than Trump, but he doesn't have the popularity Trump does with the public and perhaps not with Trump's allies.   His wife is a Hindu woman of Indian ethnicity and this alienates him from racist people on the far right.   But he would have time to rebrand his party, himself for the 2028 elections if Trump quit.

1icoptz;Liberal;Inherent Liberalism vs Learned Conservatism;I grew up in a pretty apolitical household- at least outwardly. I was taught to be empathetic, kind, helpful, generous, and loving as well as embrace those feelings that I already had inside me. Guess what I turned out to be. And yet you see people who grew up in conservative or conservative adjacent households who end up adopting the same selfish and blind values and principles as the environment they grew up in. They’re taught to idolize people who preach isolationism, selfishness, callousness and cruelty in the name of strength and what they perceive as “fairness.” It’s almost as if liberalism is just inherent human kindness and empathy and conservatism is a learned behavior born out of fear and insecurity. I say this because some people that I knew as a kid who were kind, bubbly, friendly people somehow ended up gravitating towards the new right wing people which flies in the face of everything I ever observed about them. I think some of their parent(s) are/were conservative or conservative leaning. This pattern or phenomenon is just further proof that liberalism is more natural than conservatism. At least modern “conservatism.”;inherent liberalism vs learned conservatism grow pretty apolitical outwardly teach empathetic kind helpful generous love embrace feeling inside guess turn people grow conservative conservative adjacent household end adopt selfish blind value principle environment grow teach idolize people preach isolationism selfishness callousness cruelty strength perceive fairness liberalism inherent human kindness empathy conservatism learn behavior bear fear insecurity people know kid kind bubbly friendly people end gravitate new right wing people fly face observe think conservative conservative leaning pattern phenomenon proof liberalism natural conservatism modern conservatism;Acuallyizadern93;6;0.64;4;2025-01-29 07:45:09;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

Though unlike other groups that use a symbol that represents hate, I am going with one that sends a positive message: ⛅.  The idea behind the emoji as a symbol is that no matter how cloudy things look, the light of a better and kinder tomorrow will shine through if we help it do so. As such, I believe in using this symbol as a sign of rebellion against 47 and his regime. Feel free to share it and use it. Feel free to ignore it and continue your day.

1ic0xnk;Liberal;Something that isn’t talked about enough;How insane it is that Trump is president again.   The biggest focal point here is January 6th. He was impeached a second time for that and had been convicted of crimes. And conservatives still wanted him and only him out of all the republican candidates. Also, for a party that preaches law and order, where’s the law and order in even letting Trump run again? I’m also looking at you, SCOTUS for giving Trump immunity.   Society somehow doesn’t think it’s messed up that you could be convicted of felonies and be eligible to hold the highest office. There’s no standards for how presidents are as people anymore. It’s to the point that me posting this in any sub not dedicated to liberals would at least lead to some comments about how stupid I am.  Democratic politicians set a good example during the vote counting process by not disputing the election results nor telling people to “fight like hell”, telling them “if you don’t fight, we’re not gonna have a country anymore”, etc.  People would say “well, look at what this former President did and what that President did”. Has any president or presidential candidate ever strongly and so openly disputed election results, then told their supporters to storm the capitol, which led to their own VP almost being killed????  I blindly assumed that Trump was done for after J6 because I thought the law would take care of him. Well, in a way they did, but he somehow was still allowed to run again and he still got just as much support as he did 8 years ago.  The hypocrisy of the Republicans supposedly being the party of law and order.

1iazsih;Liberal;Remember the right wing 2009 TEA Party?  Liberals need something just like that!;"Remember the right wing 2009 TEA Party protests? TEA=Taxed Enough Already. FOX News constantly pushed the refrain that Obama would raise taxes to finance Obamacare -and that he wouldn't raise taxes on his rich friends. The right went crazy. The midterms were a bloodbath.  TEA partiers ran for office everywhere - and did REALLY well.  The name, TEA Party, was genius because it linked so nicely to the Boston Tea Party.  I'm not smart enough to think up something similar - but certainly someone in the Reddit world is.  The TEA party was all about reining in presidential power and government in general.  Every time Obama signed an executive order, the right went freaking nuts.  'Up' is now officially 'down.'  We should be taking advantage of that!  **Edit to add:**  Lots of ""But this..."" and ""But that..."" replies.  However, this post has 90% approval.  This isn't a perfect idea - but we seem to agree that SOMETHING effective needs to happen.  **How about ""The King movement""?**  It came to me after monkeyangst pointed out that MAGA folks misspell ""rein in"" as ""reign in.""  We could literally use it.  ""King"" links us to Dr. MLK Jr. - who created great change peacefully.  It also reminds people that if we don't do something quick, we are doomed to be ruled by the rich.    Amconmichael pointed out that the TEA Party was really an anti Black president party.   I agree.  Their stated purpose was to push back against too much government power.  We have the same stated purpose, but technically, we would be an anti orange president party.    brodievonorchard pointed out that the TEA Party was quickly astroturfed by the oil baron Koch bro pricks.  True - and Big Oil is still big shit - but if the TEA Party's true purpose was to thwart a Black president, then didn't that exact scenario just happen?    Fitz\_2112b points out that the TEA Party morphed into MAGA - which is now a face-eating leopard oligarchy.  True.  Are we saying that with the threat of astroturfing and leopard-face-eating, maybe we shouldn't go there?   Fuck it - if we do nothing, if we don't even try, we've already lost.  I don't see how we could make this - the incredible division of Americans - worse.

1iapjf4;Liberal;Democrats need to hurry up and work on 2028.; It seems like AOC and Buttigieg are the only Democrats who know how to talk to the media.   I don’t think AOC would be a good candidate in 2028. Maybe someday she’ll be president, but first I’d like to see her win a statewide election.   I don’t love Buttigieg, but he could be an okay option. I like that his experience includes the white house and the military. I don’t like McKinsey, but he has mostly washed off the stink of that by now. I don’t like that the highest elected office he’s held is mayor.   Anybody else who wants to be president needs to get their name out there. They need to be on CNN, The Daily Show, The Late Show, the View, SNL, Youtube shows, and podcasts. They each need to brainstorm a few dozen memorable one-liners that summarize their positions, and then say all of them in public until one of them sticks.   They need to step slightly left of their comfort zone. I’m not suggesting that they should take a far-left stance on all of the issues, but they each need to have one leftist viewpoint that distinguishes them from Nancy Pelosi.   I’ll gladly admit to my own ignorance. I have no idea what the following people are doing or saying right now: Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer, Mark Kelly, or Cory Booker. I don’t even know who Ruben Gallego, JB Pritzker, or Wes Moore are (I found their names in a Newsweek article). The thing is that most voters are at least as ignorant as I am.

Like most of you ... I'm scared.    But ... We aren't out numbered at all.  By the numbers ...  US Population - 335 million  Roughly: 73 million people under the age of 18  Roughly: 160 million registered voters in the country  Total votes cast in 2024: 152.3 million (8 million didn't show up)   Trump won by 2.2 million  So!  335 million people minus those under 18 ... Minus the people who did vote is ...   That's about 100 million people who are eligible to but not registered to vote.  That means, there are approx 108 million people right there who arent registered, active or paying attention. And you KNOW of those 108 million ... They're certainly not ALL Trump supporters.   And - 77ish million people voted from Trump. That number is a scant 23% of our total population. It's still too high of course, but let me say that again ... TWENTY-THREE PER CENT.   So take heart! All is not lost and we are NOT out umbered. The media wants us to think we are doomed. We absolutely are not. BUT ... Somehow the folks who have tuned it all out need to be activated somehow.   Frankly ... I'm daring to have a modicum of hope for mid-terms ... But it is gonna be a long fucking two years!    I just peeked at Arizona and Trump won the vote by a measly 200k.

1ia0ce9;Liberal;the new era of self-education;TLDR: what are some of the most impactful books you've read that debunked the myths you were told in school?  with Trump changing course syllabi,  I have never felt more strongly about the power of self-education.  more than ever, I feel it is my duty to read books, books from those of us who are outliers in society, those of us who tell history, not as *his story* but as a true and full story of the events that unfolded.  the things we learn in schools, they are not a be-all end-all of knowledge. the breadth and depth of the things we learn in school is widely censored, carefully scripted to fit the narratives of the board of directors and institution administrators, many of whom are conservative in their own right.  there were many myths i learned in school that took time to debunk. and the debunking did not come from textbook history books. they came from independent historians with a vision to share the truth, the whole truth, the good, the bad, the ugly.  PS.   The Angel who arrived to share the joyous news of Jesus Christ's birth chose to appear in front of a group of shepherds, who at the time were outcasts, cursed to the outskirts of the city where they tended their flocks and slept under the night sky.  even though Jesus had arrived to save the world, he was born in a lowly manger, birthed in a bed of hay.  he spent his life healing the weak and uplifting the poor, the disenfranchised, the ones marginalized from society.   so many of our leaders, leaders who threaten to take away rights, freeze or fire jobs, and allow the destruction of corporate greed to degrade the planet, use Christianity as the flame for their fire.   and perhaps many of us voted in thinking they stood for the ideologies they preached. but its only after I read the Bible, as someone not born into Christianity, having never gone to church, or communion, that I understood Jesus' mission. thats the power of self-education.   BTW. im only using Jesus here because many of us are Christian and may relate better to his story. But I've also enjoyed reading texts from the Bhagavad Gita, Qu'ran, Pali Cannon, and Torah.;new era self education tldr impactful book read debunk myth tell school trump change course syllabi feel strongly power self education feel duty read book book outlier society tell history story true story event unfold thing learn school end knowledge breadth depth thing learn school widely censor carefully script fit narrative board director institution administrator conservative right myth learn school take time debunk debunking come textbook history book come independent historian vision share truth truth good bad ugly ps angel arrive share joyous news jesus christ birth choose appear group shepherd time outcast curse outskirt city tend flock sleep night sky jesus arrive save world bear lowly manger birth bed hay spend life heal weak uplift poor disenfranchised one marginalize society leader leader threaten away right freeze fire job allow destruction corporate greed degrade planet use christianity flame fire vote think stand ideology preach read bible bear christianity have go church communion understand jesus mission s power self education btw m jesus christian relate well story enjoy read text bhagavad gita pali cannon torah;In4thelongrun_;2;0.59;5;2025-01-25 23:37:25;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1i95d9i;Liberal;Reactionary nihilism of right-wing politics risks catastrophe;You don’t have to be an engineer to grasp how a gargantuan construction can disintegrate in a flash.  [Adam Gabbatt reports](https://www.alternet.org/katherine-stewart-oligarchs/) on Katherine Stewart’s forthcoming book, [***Money, Lies, and God: Inside the Movement to Destroy American Democracy***](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1429656500). One section of his report is terrifyingly profound.  Stewart describes “‘**reactionary nihilism**’...  reactionary in the sense that it expresses itself as mortal opposition to a perceived catastrophic change in the political order, it is nihilistic because its deepest **premise is that the actual world is devoid of value, impervious to reason**, and governable only through brutal acts of will…. It stands for a kind of unraveling of the American political mind — a madness that now afflicts one side of nearly every political debate.”  Widespread embrace of that nihilistic premise should terrify anyone capable of looking at our global society through the eyes of an engineer. Watch the TV show “Engineering Catastrophes.” A bad glue job on a train engine camshaft can lead to half of a town being burned to the ground. One loose bolt or dropped wrench can inexorably result in the collapse of bridge formwork or in a missile silo explosion. Engineers learn that with big builds, even the tiniest incorrect detail can lead to catastrophe.  Our current fossil fuel civilization is more intricate and interconnected than any bridge, plane, or high rise. Surely handing over US government power to people whose worldview is impervious to reason is extraordinarily more dangerous than a loose bolt. Faith might work well enough in the narrow confines of religious observance or an online conspiracy group. Faith alone is not compatible with the science and engineering upon which our quality of life, and our lives themselves, depend.;reactionary nihilism right wing politic risk catastrophe engineer grasp gargantuan construction disintegrate flash adam gabbatt katherine stewart katherine stewart forthcoming book money lies god inside movement destroy american section report terrifyingly profound stewart describe reactionary nihilism reactionary sense express mortal opposition perceive catastrophic change political order nihilistic deep premise actual world devoid value impervious reason governable brutal act stand kind unraveling american political mind madness afflict nearly political debate widespread embrace nihilistic premise terrify capable look global society eye engineer watch tv engineering catastrophes bad glue job train engine camshaft lead half town burn ground loose bolt drop wrench inexorably result collapse bridge formwork missile silo explosion engineer learn big build tiny incorrect detail lead catastrophe current fossil fuel civilization intricate interconnect bridge plane high rise surely handing government power people worldview impervious reason extraordinarily dangerous loose bolt faith work narrow confine religious observance online conspiracy group faith compatible science engineering quality life life depend;HumanistRuth;16;0.91;2;2025-01-24 20:38:52;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

Meaning, we all have friends/family members who overtly supported trump.

Often, we try to convert or talk someone into doing something different, and this is one time when converting is not possible, and trying to, may be wasting time, and people continued what they did, knowing they would not lose friends or family.  Too often we are nice and avoid things that might upset people. But this is one time I do not care. For   me, are the suffering and death of people worth me dealing with upset people? Hell yes.

1i7kq0k;Liberal;Contradictory Conservatives: A Call for Reflection; I’m not deeply entrenched in politics, nor do I hate conservatives or MAGA supporters as a group. I prefer to judge individuals based on their character and actions. That said, I’ve observed what feels like a significant transformation within the conservative movement over the past 16 years.  In the 2000s, the Republican Party seemed to stand on foundational principles—issues like abortion, gun control, government overreach, and border security. These principles, while debatable, were often presented with a degree of respect and thoughtfulness. The rise of Trump, however, ushered in a new era of conservatism. It feels more aggressive, less tethered to intellectual consistency, and more pervasive in our daily lives, thanks in part to platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.  This increased exposure has prompted me to examine conservative ideologies more critically, alongside their liberal counterparts. Through logical reasoning and exploring potential contradictions, I’ve identified some striking paradoxes within the modern conservative movement. While these aren’t novel insights, I hope to open a dialogue for further exploration and understanding.  The Pro-Life Paradox  Conservatives frequently champion a zero-tolerance approach to abortion. They argue that life begins at conception and that a fetus, regardless of development stage, has an inalienable right to life. For many, this belief is rooted in a sincere desire to protect innocent life. On its surface, this seems noble, even compelling. Most people, regardless of political affiliation, would agree that late-term abortions—except in extreme cases—should be restricted.  Yet, conservatives apply this logic inconsistently. If the moral imperative to protect life is so absolute, why is there no parallel outcry to address the leading cause of death among children and teenagers in the U.S.—guns? Conservatives cling to the Second Amendment as if it’s untouchable, yet their unwillingness to consider even modest reforms stands in stark contrast to their self-professed commitment to protecting life.  This inconsistency deepens when we examine their position on the future of the very fetuses they fight to save. Imagine a fetus they protect today grows up into a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy—perhaps due to assault, health risks, or financial instability. The same conservatives who fought for her right to be born would now deny her autonomy, forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term, regardless of the consequences.  If the pro-life movement truly values life, why isn’t there a push for universal pre-K, affordable childcare, or free school lunch programs? Where is the investment in the well-being of American youth? Instead, we see an intense focus on banning drag show readings while programs that directly benefit children languish.  This raises the question: do conservatives truly value life, or is their interest in protecting the unborn merely a means to exert control over personal freedoms?  The Trump Contradiction  Trump’s presidency and influence have brought contradictions within the conservative movement into sharp focus. For instance, conservatives cheered Trump’s recent executive order to repeal electric vehicle mandates, celebrating his commitment to oil and gas. Yet, the advisor he tapped for this initiative is the CEO of the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer. How does this align with their narrative?  Consider Trump’s actions on TikTok. In 2020, he signed an executive order to ban the app, citing national security concerns over Chinese ownership. Conservatives rallied behind him, lauding his toughness on China. Fast forward to today, and TikTok’s reinstatement is celebrated as a victory for free speech. Conveniently forgotten is Trump’s role in the original ban, as is the fact that a major American investor in TikTok is one of his donors.  The contradictions extend to immigration, one of Trump’s hallmark issues. In February 2024, a bipartisan border bill was proposed. The legislation would have tightened asylum standards and automatically secured the border if illegal crossings exceeded certain thresholds. Trump, however, opposed the bill, calling it a “gift to the Democrats.” Following his condemnation, Senate Republicans abandoned it, and the bill failed. Conservatives who revere Trump as the ultimate defender of the border have remained silent about his role in blocking legislation that could have reduced illegal immigration.  The Larger Question  These are just a few examples of what I see as glaring contradictions within the conservative movement. How can conservatives reconcile being pro-life while disregarding the lives of pregnant women, children, and teens killed by gun violence? How do they explain supporting a president whose actions often undermine the very principles they claim to hold dear?  I don’t ask these questions to inflame or mock but to encourage meaningful dialogue. I want to hear from you. Share your thoughts, provide your perspectives, and help deepen this conversation.

1i7koru;Liberal;The Dred Scott case has no relevance to the second amendment;"It’s my understanding that gun advocates sometimes use the 1857 *Dred Scott v. Sandford* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/#tab-opinion-1964281)) decision to make the argument that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns.  Just a few examples of 2A advocates making this argument are [this video](https://youtu.be/2W8sppSylVU?si=Nc8sFW1RGujByEjl&t=129), [this video](https://youtu.be/neLdsW7XZSM?si=5wz8HCrInl1s6KCi&t=605), and [this video](https://youtu.be/6vglHW9q2Ek?si=DUs36IP8dXJ6Sp6G&t=101), as well as written examples such as these: [link 1](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=345),[ link 2](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/mcrp-journal/blog/the-second-amendment-is-racist-why-bruen-should-have-been-decided-on-equal-protection-grounds/),[ link 3](https://harvardlawreview.org/forum/vol-135/racist-gun-laws-and-the-second-amendment/).  In fact, even Justice Clarence Thomas connects *Dred Scott* to the second amendment in his opinion for *NYSRPA vs Bruen* ([link](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/597/20-843/#tab-opinion-4600259)).  Most of their argument seems to stem from this excerpt from the opinion in that case written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney:  >More especially, it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding States regarded them as included in the word citizens, or would have consented to a Constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another State. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety. **It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished, and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak, to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went.** And all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color, both free and slaves, and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them, and endangering the peace and safety of the State.  The portion I’ve put in bold appears to be what some argue is a synopsis of the federal Bill of Rights, and the statement saying “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to be a reference to the second amendment.  Gun advocates would argue that if the Supreme Court in 1857 believed that the second amendment guaranteed a citizen an individual right to keep and carry a gun, then this must also have been the traditional and authentic interpretation of that amendment.  However, I don’t understand how this argument is valid.  It seems to me that one could only come to the aforementioned conclusion if one has not actually read the context in which the above paragraph appears.  Earlier, Justice Taney had begun his opinion by presenting a list of state laws which placed explicit restrictions upon the rights and privileges of the black populations of the respective states.  These laws dated from colonial times through to the then-present day.  Taney’s reasoning was essentially that it made no sense for a “negro” that was a slave or a descendant of slaves imported from Africa to become a citizen, because the sum of all of the discriminatory and prohibitive laws that had been passed against the black populations strongly indicates that it had been the general will of the individual states to subjugate the black populations in the interest of public peace and security.  And when the individual states ratified the Constitution in order to join into a union under a federal government, the individual states vested to the federal government the protection of their peace and safety, and thus, it would be inappropriate for the federal government to betray this trust by giving citizenship to a demographic which the individual states themselves had seen fit to subjugate.     Among the list of discriminatory laws he mentions, the first is a 1717 law from Maryland which declared  >”that if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white woman, or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto woman, such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life, excepting mulattoes born of white women, who, for such intermarriage, shall only become servants for seven years, to be disposed of as the justices of the county court where such marriage so happens shall think fit, to be applied by them towards the support of a public school within the said county. And any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as aforesaid with any negro or mulatto, such white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven years, and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid, and be applied to the uses aforesaid.""   Then he mentions a 1705 Massachusetts law which declared that  >""if any negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the English or other Christian nation, such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped, at the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be convicted.""   And another law from the same state declares  >""that none of her Majesty's English or Scottish subjects, nor of any other Christian nation, within this province, shall contract matrimony with any negro or mulatto, nor shall any person, duly authorized to solemnize marriage, presume to join any such in marriage, on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds, one moiety thereof to her Majesty, for and towards the support of the Government within this province, and the other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same, in any of her Majesty's courts of record within the province, by bill, plaint, or information.""   He later on mentions a 1774 Connecticut provision  >by which any negro, Indian, or mulatto servant who was found wandering out of the town or place to which he belonged without a written pass such as is therein described was made liable to be seized by anyone, and taken before the next authority to be examined and delivered up to his master -- who was required to pay the charge which had accrued thereby. And a subsequent section of the same law provides that if any free negro shall travel without such pass, and shall be stopped, seized, or taken up, he shall pay all charges arising thereby. And this law was in full operation when the Constitution of the United States was adopted, and was not repealed till 1797. So that, up to that time, free negroes and mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves in the police regulations established by the laws of the State.   And then another Connecticut law in 1833 which…  >made it penal to set up or establish any school in that State for the instruction of persons of the African race not inhabitants of the State, or to instruct or teach in any such school or institution, or board or harbor for that purpose, any such person without the previous consent in writing of the civil authority of the town in which such school or institution might be.   Justice Taney mentions a provision in New Hampshire  in 1815, in which  >no one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the State but free white citizens, and the same provision is found in a subsequent collection of the laws made in 1855. Nothing could more strongly mark the entire repudiation of the African race. The alien is excluded because, being born in a foreign country, he cannot be a member of the community until he is naturalized. But why are the African race, born in the State, not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of the citizen? The answer is obvious, he is not, by the institutions and laws of the State, numbered among its people. He forms no part of the sovereignty of the State, and is not therefore called on to uphold and defend it.   And finally he mentions an 1822 Rhode Island law  >forbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage from joining in marriage any white person with any negro, Indian, or mulatto, under the penalty of two hundred dollars, and declaring all such marriages absolutely null and void, and the same law was again reenacted in its revised code of 1844. So that, down to the last-mentioned period, the strongest mark of inferiority and degradation was fastened upon the African race in that State.   It is after his list of such restrictive and discriminatory laws that Justice Taney extrapolates that if it was the will of the states to exclude the black population from the status of citizenship within each of their respective dominions, then it is only appropriate that the same demographic be excluded from citizenship by the national government into which the respective states had vested their collective interests.  As Taney states,  >For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety.   And then it is here where Taney states the excerpt which pro-gun advocates so often emphasize:  >It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished, and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak, to hold public meetings upon political affairs, *and to keep and carry arms wherever they went*.  Upon looking at the larger context of this excerpt, it would seem that the excerpt doesn’t actually mean what the pro-gun advocates interpret it to mean.  First of all, it would seem that some of the items within this excerpt correlate with the prohibitive laws previously mentioned.  The first is when he mentions “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport . . . .”  This correlates with the aforementioned 1774 Connecticut provision that required people of color to carry a pass when wandering outside the town of their residence.  And the second correlated item is -- in my interpretation -- the infamous line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”.   I understand this line to be an allusion to the 1815 New Hampshire law which limited the right of militia duty to only free white citizens of the state.     Gun-rights advocates would likely interpret the latter line to refer to the text of the second amendment, and to refer to an individual right to own and carry guns for private purposes, such as self defense or sport.  However, it makes no sense for the line “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” to refer to the text of the second amendment.  Even though this line may sound similar to the line “the right of the people to keep and bear arms”, they are not the same, and the differences between the two are not at all negligible.  First of all, the second amendment refers to the right to “bear arms”, while the line from *Dred Scott* says “carry arms”.  The modern reader may simply see these two phrases as synonymous, but they are not.  The meaning of “carry arms” is straightforward, consisting of a transitive verb acting upon a noun, but the phrase “bear arms” does not actually refer to the carrying of arms, but rather is itself a phrasal verb and an idiomatic expression.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary -- the most authoritative resource on the English language -- the expression “bear arms” originated around AD 1325, and is correlated with the Latin phrase *arma ferre*, likely being simply a direct translation of the Latin.  Also according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase is defined simply as “To serve as a soldier, to fight (for a country, cause, etc.).”  The sense of the phrase ""the right to bear arms"" in the sense that pro-gun advocates typically use the phrase is, according to the Oxford dictionary, an originally and chiefly American re-definition of the phrase, originating circa 1776.  Hence, the second amendment references the right of the people to keep arms and *to fight* and/or *serve as a soldier*, while the *Dred Scott* line instead references the right to keep arms and carry arms.    Furthermore, the *Dred Scott* line also differs from the second amendment by including the modifier “wherever they went”.  No such modifier exists in the second amendment.  In fact, the second amendment is merely a prohibitive provision, one which is applied against Congress itself, and does not directly apply any affirmative granting of rights to the people.  It makes no sense to interpret an absolute prohibition against Congress as somehow establishing a modified affirming of rights to the people.  Because of these linguistic and textual details, it is, at best, quite a stretch to claim that the phrase “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” is somehow a meaningful reference to the second amendment.  Some might alternatively argue that the line, rather than referring to the text of the second amendment specifically, is instead referring to the liberty of private gun use in general.  But what makes much more sense is that the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went”, instead of referring to private gun use, actually refers to militia duty.  It was customary in early America for militiamen to possess arms -- such as muskets or rifles -- in their personal custody (i.e. “to keep arms”), and to literally carry them wherever they went.  We can see evidence of this from numerous militia-related laws from early America from colonial times until the 20th century.  On example is a New York law from 1640:  >ORDINANCE  >Of the Director and Council of New Netherland, providing for the Arming and mustering of the Militia in case of danger. Passed 9 May, 1640.  >\[N.Y. Col. MSS. IV. 61.\]  >The Honble Director and Council have considered it advisable to ordain that the Inhabitants residing at and around Fort Amsterdam, of what state, quality or condition soever they be, *shall each provide himself with a good gun and keep the same in good repair and at all times ready and in order*, and as they live at a distance the one from the other, every warned person is placed under his Corporal in order that in time of danger he may appear at his post with his gun. Should it happen, which God forbid, that any mischief occur either from enemies or traitors at night, the people will be notified by the discharge of three cannon fired in quick succession, and if by day, means will be found to give warning to every one, who is commanded thereupon to repair instantly to his Corporal at the place appointed and then to adopt such measures as the exigency of the case shall require, on pain of being fined Fifty guilders.

other similar militia laws:  [1786 New Hampshire](https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1786-n-h-laws-409-10-an-act-for-forming-and-regulating-the-militia-within-this-state-and-for-repealing-all-the-laws-heretofore-made-for-that-purpose-c2a7-7)

it would seem that with a deeper understanding of the workings of the militia during early American history, the modifier “wherever they went” should more sensibly be correlated with the common practices surrounding compulsory militia service, rather than being correlated with any sort of voluntary liberty of carrying arms for private purposes.    The connection that the pro-gun community makes between *Dred Scott* and the second amendment is tenuous at best.  Within the passage in bold from *Dred Scott*, there are four stated civil rights: the right to travel freely without a pass, the right to freedom of speech, the right to hold public meetings on political issues, and the right to keep and carry arms.  Of these four rights, only one of them can be said to correlate directly to the Bill of Rights: the right of freedom of speech.  The rest have no connection to the Bill of Rights.  And to assume that the phrase “to keep and carry arms” is directly related to the second amendment is a stretch, since the language between the two statements has only a superficial correlation.  These stated civil rights in bold do not represent the contents of the Bill of Rights, and thus cannot be interpreted as a general reference to that document, and the phrase “to keep and carry arms wherever they went” does not represent the second amendment directly, for these reasons, there is simply no argument that this passage from *Dred Scott* supports second amendment rights.     Of the four stated civil rights, it would appear that Justice Taney mentions two of them as allusions to previously mentioned statutes: the line “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” correlates to the aforementioned 1815 New Hampshire militia law which excluded black people from militia service, and an even more obvious connection is made between the line “the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased . . . without pass or passport” and the 1774 Connecticut law requiring black people to carry a pass while traveling.    The other two stated civil rights -- freedom of speech and the right to hold public meetings -- appear to be outliers of this pattern, as they appear to have been mentioned without any aforementioned precedent in state law.  However, there might still be a particular reason why Justice Taney saw fit to mention these particular rights.  It so happens that most of the items listed in the bolded excerpt are also stipulated in the Declaration of Rights in the 1820 Missouri State Constitution.  This is especially relevant since the *Dred Scott* case centered on whether the plaintiff was still considered a slave in the slave state of Missouri after having gained his freedom after traveling to the free state of Illinois.  Notably, the two outlier items are also addressed in the Missouri Constitution.  The statement from *Dred Scott* which says “and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 16:  >That the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and that every person may freely speak, write, and print, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.   And the statement “to hold public meetings upon political affairs” appears to correlate with Article 13, Clause 2:  >That the people of this state have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof, and of altering and abolishing their constitution and form of government, whenever it may be necessary to their safety and happiness.  Furthermore, in addition to their connection to the discriminatory laws already established within the text of *Dred Scott*, the remaining two items from the excerpt also appear to have correlates in the Missouri Constitution as well.  The statement about the right of a citizen “to enter every other State whenever they pleased” appears to correlate with a clause in Article 3, section 26:  >It shall be their \[the general assembly’s\] duty, as soon as may be, to pass such laws as may be necessary--1. To prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and settling in this State, under any pretext whatsoever,   And it also seems to correlate with Article 13, Clause 21:  > That migration from this state cannot be prohibited.  And the statement “and to keep and carry arms wherever they went” appears to correlate with the state arms provision in part of Article 13, Clause 3:  >that their right to bear arms, in defense of themselves and of the state, cannot be questioned.  Compared to the second amendment, this arms provision in the Missouri Constitution seems more pertinent to the arms statement mentioned in the *Dred Scott* decision, since this provision specifically qualifies the lawful purposes for which the right to bear arms may be exercised, which the second amendment does not do.  **Conclusion**  Some might say that it only makes sense that Justice Taney is referring to the federal Bill of Rights in the bolded excerpt because he is speaking on behalf of the United States Supreme Court, which is a federal body.  However, this interpretation is uninformed.  When we look at the actual context of the *Dred Scott* decision, it is clear that the particular point that Justice Taney is making in that excerpt pertains much more to state law than to federal law.  Even though the decision that Justice Taney is making is a federal decision, he is clearly making this federal decision based on state premises.  It has never been the primary prerogative of the federal government to grant rights to American citizens.  It is state governments that have the primary authority and function of specifying and granting civil rights.  Hence, Justice Taney wasn't saying that making black people into citizens -- at the federal level -- would give them rights, his point was that federally making black people into citizens would effectively negate the prohibitive laws that the states have established in order to subjugate their black populations.  In other words, making black people into citizens would create a kind of ""double negative"" whose effect is a positive: it would not actually give them anything, but instead would *take away* the laws that *take away* their liberties.  The verbiage ""it would *give* to persons of the negro race..."" is hence metaphorical rather than literal.  It's like if a judge were to exonerate a convicted prison inmate through DNA evidence: the judge isn't actually *giving* the inmate his freedom, the judge is just *removing* his incarceration.  Thus, it is merely the result of a quirk of language and rhetoric that Justice Taney *appears* to be affirming that American citizens are entitled to the liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they go.  But for gun advocates to take this rhetoric literally, as they often do, is simply a wrong conclusion to draw  As for the content of the bolded excerpt, I can’t say how purposeful or how arbitrary this particular assortment of rights was meant to be.  At least two of the four items appear to be references to state laws which he had previously referenced, yet he breaks this pattern with the other two items, which do not have any statutory precursor in *Dred Scott*, and there are even more state laws referenced earlier that he *does not* allude to in the bolded list.  And furthermore, all of the items in the list could be said to have correlates in the 1820 Missouri Constitution, but it is not clear whether Justice Taney was actually alluding to that constitution in particular -- because of its relevance to the case at hand, or if he was referencing any other state constitution.  In summary, I don’t know exactly why Justice Taney chose the particular list of items that he chose in the bolded excerpt of his majority opinion in *Dred Scott*, however, I can say with much more confidence what this excerpt *does not* indicate.  He is not referencing the federal Bill of Rights as a whole, he is not referencing the second amendment in particular, and he is likely not referencing the general liberty of private firearm rights.  Therefore, there is no basis for pro-gun advocates to use this case as a means to argue for firearm rights.    What are your thoughts about my argument?";dred scott case relevance second amendment understanding gun advocate use dred scott

1i7i0we;Liberal;It is time to sell your Tesla and divest of Elon Musk companies for real now.;I know 20+ liberals who own Teslas or Starlink, with a few Powerwalls in Phoenix, etc. etc. If you’re a liberal and own a Tesla or any Elon Musk product, it’s time to sell it—and any shares you hold in Elon Musk companies—to someone whose political ideology is more aligned with his.  When you meet the buyer to complete the transaction, I suggest adopting the emerging conservative salute: raise your hand to your chest and then extend it outward at a 45-degree angle, aggressively yet straight. This reassures the potentially autistic buyer that you are familiar with the long-established and frequently cited (at least in America) norms and salutations of the Roman Republic.  Joking aside, Elon causes harm to marginalized and vulnerable communities and remains unapologetic when it’s brought to his attention. He has the capacity to do significantly more harm if he chooses—and it seems he does. This divestment isn’t about “sending a message” though it may, it’s about finding peace of mind. Should significant harm befall his perceived enemies, at least you can say you had no part in it.  To help you get in the right mindset, here’s an artist’s interpretation of this Nazi-lover returning your money:  卐 (ಠ益ಠ)つ💰 --> (ಥ‿ಥ);time sell tesla div elon musk company real know liberal teslas starlink powerwalls phoenix etc etc liberal tesla elon musk product time sell share hold elon musk company political ideology align meet buyer complete transaction suggest adopt emerge conservative salute raise hand chest extend outward degree angle aggressively straight reassure potentially autistic buyer familiar long establish frequently cite america norm salutation roman republic joke aside elon cause harm marginalize vulnerable community remain unapologetic bring attention capacity significantly harm choose divestment send message find peace mind significant harm befall perceive enemy help right mindset artist interpretation nazi lover return money 卐;manoteee;391;0.94;97;2025-01-22 18:27:18;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1i6u113;Liberal;It was a Nazi salute full stop.;"Some have defended Elon’s Sieg Heil at the White House as being a ""Roman salute."" Right. Even some very liberal people are tired of hearing the Nazi comparisons. I strongly agree, and when these men stop acting like Nazis, we can stop making the comparisons.      Fascism is a virus that exploits a decent person’s good nature and desire for patience and understanding. It twists your desire for normalcy into a weapon and turns it back on you. If you do not speak out or act against it, you are complicit in it. It cannot be voted away (if that’s not already obvious). Patience and “understanding” are its fuel. The Nazi does not speak in your language, its only form of communication is fear and violence. You cannot “wait it out,” as no amount of blood can satiate it. It isn’t tied to a single person or party—though it often prefers the right—it will inhabit whatever host isn’t actively fighting it. It is, in effect, a living, breathing villain with unlimited time and resources at its disposal—like Satan.      Four hundred thousand American grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and others gave their lives fighting fascism, with many millions more gravely injured or scarred by trauma. Many of us have seen the legacy of this damage firsthand. The absurdity of a man now making the hand gesture meant to praise Hitler and swear loyalty to him spits on that sacrifice. In fact, “spits on” is an understatement, it’s the biggest “fuck you” I can imagine being made to a veteran of that era.      And because no block of text on an issue of this magnitude is complete without an adjoining quote:   “If there are nine people and one Nazi at a table, there are ten Nazis at the table.”";nazi salute stop defend elon sieg heil white house roman salute right liberal people tired hear nazi comparison strongly agree man stop act like nazis stop make comparison fascism virus exploit decent person good nature desire patience understanding twist desire normalcy weapon turn speak act complicit vote away obvious patience understanding fuel nazi speak language form communication fear violence wait blood satiate tie single person party prefer right inhabit host actively fight effect living breathe villain unlimited time resource disposal like satan thousand american grandfather great grandfather give life fight fascism million gravely injure scar trauma see legacy damage firsthand absurdity man make hand gesture mean praise hitler swear loyalty spit sacrifice fact spit understatement big fuck imagine veteran era block text issue magnitude complete adjoining quote people nazi table nazis table;manoteee;846;0.93;114;2025-01-21 21:35:34;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

Buy from a local business. Buy art from a local artist.  Take up a new hobby. Get off the internet. Things will always seem worse online than they really are. Find something engrossing you can do away from the computer. A new hobby is also a great way to make new friends and cultivate a community.  Send a physical letter to someone.

When (predictably) asked if they will target Cartel in Mexico, Trump said ""Maybe"" and that ""stranger things have happened"" along with a promise ""to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gang criminal networks.""  When asked how México may feel about it, Trump said to ask them how they feel (I am anxiously awaiting Sheinbaum's response).  I personally have been keeping up with Sheinbaum as a president, and she is very serious. She is Mexico's 2nd leftist president in decades, the first being her predecesor Obrador (AMLO). The interesting thing is that Obrador cleaned up a ton of government corruption and illegal activity, embezzlement etc. The Cartel is still active (in some areas more than others) but it's not close to how bad it was 30+ years ago. Sheinbaum is more leftist than he is and is furthering what he started. But make no mistake she is very no-nonsense and has clearly been preparing for whatever the U.S. may try once Trump took office. They have been moving Mexico to be less dependent on the U.S. by increasing domestic productions and trading with europe  So, *when* the U.S. inevitably kills Mexican citizens in Mexico because the U.S. has designated them terrorists, what happens next? Mexico very well could consider it an act of terrorism themselves, or just an act of outright war.

To a future where other countries will fear us because we will take what we want because ""Macht ist Recht"", and where they no longer respect us or look up to us for our democratic institutions and ideals and commitment to them.   Dark times are ahead and we must resist them lest society's privileges are enjoyed only by card carrying MAGATs, and the words ""USA"" become scorned and despised like ""Nazi"" by future generations around the world.

Same can be said about states like TX. Some of the blue states seem to have more people leaving than there are people moving to them.   Will this election change that? We know that the quality of life in red and blue states is vastly different. It can even be argued that it can be seen on the county level. Blue states have more social programs, more consumer protections, workers' rights, and other things that can really aid people should they hit hard times as well as protect them from some of those hard times from occurring in the first place. Red states, by large, don't have these things or they are rendered useless because they are so limited or not enforced properly.  We also know a Republican controlled Congress (no matter how slim) and Trump's presidency will undoubtedly make things much harder for a lot of people no matter what state you live in. When this comes, will people rely more on those protections and programs that blue states have? Will they decide that it is worth moving out of red states in favor of blue states since there isn't a federal government that will protect them? Will there be an awakening to the importance of state government and how will all this affect the next election? ;election cause shift population movement state right south east state large population move state say state like tx blue state people leave people move election change know quality life red blue state vastly different argue see county level blue state social program consumer protection worker right thing aid people hit hard time protect hard time occur place red state large thing render useless limited enforce properly know republican control congress matter slim trump presidency undoubtedly thing hard lot people matter state live come people rely protection program blue state decide worth move red state favor blue state federal government protect awakening importance state government affect election;Ashamed-Complaint423;49;0.94;66;2025-01-15 06:52:44;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0
1i1q3xn;Liberal;Right wing voters thinking discrimination isn't an issue in America nowadays because of equal rights;"There's this guy on youtube that kinda goes around asking people what rights minorities in America don't have (he doesn't exactly say it like that all the time) and ofc he's right wing and most of his viewers are too  Ive noticed his content tends to gaslight people into thinking we are overreacting when we say stuff like homophobia, misogyny and racism are still current issues and some right wing voters immediately shut that idea down because of the equal rights everyone in America has. They seem to believe the homophobia/racism is just petty discourse online and isn't really as big of an issue as we make it out to be because we aren't  in the 1900s anymore and everyone is ""equal""  I want to refer to something I learnt in History class called the five stages of isolation, which is basically a progression of actions leading to mass genocide by Hitler and many other cruel dictators from the past. The first stage was bias attitude, second was act of bias, third was systemic discrimination, fourth was bias motivated violence and fifth was obviously genocide.

1i0s08h;Liberal;The Conservatives are using the L.A. fires to begin the attempt to make a Republican Governor of California. (Rant);Gavin Newsom will be termed out in 2026. The Conservatives kept mentioning him as a possible replacement for Joe Biden in the 2024 election. I suspect they are expecting him to run in 2028 and are already gearing up a smear campaign to knock him out of the primaries.   Right now they are blaming the fires on Democrat leadership. My guess is that the Conservatives, who now basically run the GOP will find a conservative candidate to run for Governor in 2026. This candidate will no doubt be endorsed by Trump.   Once Trump officially takes office, I expect Comer and Jordan to launch the first investigation of the year against Newsom and the Mayor of L.A (a Black female Democrat). It will be a show trial that doesn’t solve anything. The main purpose is to make the people of California think the Democrats are idiots. If it works is a different story.   What I find funny is how hypocritical the conservatives are. During the election they hated the “Hollywood elites”. Now they sympathize with them for losing the their million dollar homes. Building reservoirs and new fire hydrants will be the “low egg and gas prices” of the 2026 California election.  Rant over. ;conservatives fire begin attempt republican governor california rant gavin newsom term conservatives keep mention possible replacement joe biden election suspect expect run gear smear campaign knock primary right blame fire democrat leadership guess conservatives basically run gop find conservative candidate run governor candidate doubt endorse trump trump officially take office expect comer jordan launch investigation year newsom mayor black female democrat trial solve main purpose people california think democrats idiot work different story find funny hypocritical conservative election hate hollywood elite sympathize lose million dollar home build reservoir new fire hydrant low egg gas price california election rant;thepeoplessgt;202;0.9;55;2025-01-13 23:30:53;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0
1i0r2k4;Liberal;Are you all quitting Meta?;"I'm sure this has already been discussed and I missed it, so hard to keep up with everything.  But, what do you all think? Should we all quit Meta? I mean, I've been wanting to reduce my time spent on social media for a while now and all that anyway. And these latest decisions could absolutely be justification I finally needed. I certainly don't like the idea that me eyeballs are generating any revenue for Zuckerberg. I already dropped Twitter for Bluesky a while ago. So, one way of looking it is we should take the high road and just #exitmeta. And when this news first broke that was my first instinct. I posted statuses saying I was leaving and that everyone could find me on Bluesky, deleted the apps off my phone, did all that.  But another way to look at it is that that's letting them win. There's been a lot of talk about how one of the big reasons that Republicans keep winning elections is that they're winning the information war. Somehow, despite us supposedly being the party of young, smart and tech savvy people, they've beat us at the online (mis)information game. We can have a totally completely different discussion on why that is, what we could have done differently but it's true. So maybe we shouldn't quit Meta. Maybe now it's up to us to double down and fight there. To all dedicate some time to add these ""community notes"" that they're going to use instead. To make sure that actual real news gets liked and shared as much as possible. Plus, a lot of my local activist organizations still use IG as their primary way of organizing. Maybe some will move to Bluesky or something else, but so far I haven't seen a huge exit by them or anything.   UPDATE: A majority of these replies have either been ""I never joined,"" or ""I quit years ago."" Which kind of speaks to my biggest concern. If none of us are on social media to combat misinformation then more people, young people, fresh voters, will be exposed to it and radicalized. I was really shocked about how much Trump improved with young and first time voters. But once you realize they get most of their information from Instagram and TikTok, and we've all abandoned those platforms with our typical scoldy, judgemental attitude towards them and people that still use them, what did we think was going to happen?

And that’s that women are allowed to shame men and look and them as predators but that same thing is looked down upon highly if you do that to a black person.   For example, It’s considered ok as a woman to be fearful and ignore a man in public if he comes up to ask for the time or directions. But if this same action was done because somebody was black it would be considered racist.   If a woman directs anger at men for harnessing “rape culture”, it’s considered ok. But if somebody said that black people harness gangster culture, it would be considered racist.   -If a woman hates men in general because of being assaulted by one, it’s considered ok by society. But if somebody hates black people because they were assaulted by a black person, it’s considered racist.   Again, not supporting racism, just calling attention to double standards.

1hycg5k;Liberal;The U.S. Judicial System Has Failed;"The purpose of the Judicial System was to ensure that no person is above the law, and that the court and/or judges are not prejudicial towards anybody simply based on elected office. The ending of Trump's first election interference case has officially proved that notion false. No president had ever tested the limits of presidential immunity like this, and it is now proven that a president is given leniencies for their crimes, putting a potential 4 year sentencing to zero. Not a fine, not community service, ZERO. The fact that a sentencing even took place today was a surprise to just about everybody, especially since it was revealed that SC Justice Alito had a personal phone call with Trump the *day before* Trump requested a delay in sentencing with the supreme court.   What Trump has been allowed to get away with just since he has left office has completely broken the judicial system. He was allowed to use stall tactics with no merits, again and again and again while the judges just kept going along with it. Held in contempt 10 times for violating gag orders, posting about the judge, their family, the jury, etc. As the prosecutor put it, Trump was ""relentless"" in his attacks on the cases, all parties involved, and even the rule of law itself. He has done irreparable damage to how the law is viewed and how it is applied. And he was able to do all of this while *not* being president, meaning as an ex-president he was given extreme leniencies that allowed him to go 6+ months after conviction to sentencing. This is (as far as I know) unprecedented even in New York City.   On the bigger scale, Trump was convicted of election interference, creating a plan to prevent information from being released that would impact the electio, and falsifying business records to hide it. All the evidence is overwhelming and decisive. What to speak of all of the evidence in his multiple other criminal cases. And now he is President-Elect, and we all have to pretend none of that exists anymore because he won a popularity contest.   Throughout all of the court proceedings for the criminal activities of Trump, he has always argued presidential immunity, even if it is clearly not in the ""official"" scope of presidential immunity. So, clearly there is an ""unofficial"" scope of presidential immunity that might just be up to the discretion of the judge? But then of course, that leads us to the highest court in the land, an un-elected board of appointed judges that for the long foreseeable future have been shaped by the felon convicted of election interference and still currently on trial for more election interference across multiple jurisdictions.

This disparity arises because each electoral vote (EV) in Wyoming represents approximately 194,690 people, while each EV in California represents about 721,670 people.  I still think that the national popular vote should be determining the presidency, regardless of which party benefits. The common argument against this—that cities like New York or Los Angeles would dominate elections—doesn’t really hold much weight in reality. Only about 32.9% of the U.S. voting-age population resides in the ten largest metro areas. Even if every single person in these metro areas voted the same way (which they don’t and wouldn’t), the remaining 67.1% of the electorate still holds substantial influence.  While the Electoral College is unlikely to be abolished, I think it should be adjusted to better reflect where people actually live. One potential solution is the ""Wyoming Rule,"" which proposes increasing the size of the U.S. House of Representatives so that the representative-to-population ratio aligns with the smallest state—currently Wyoming. This adjustment would redistribute electoral votes more fairly:  California - 71 EV (+33%)  Texas - 53 EV (+34%)  Florida - 39 EV (+32%)  ...  Rhode Island - 4 EV (+0%)  Vermont - 3 EV (+0%)  Wyoming - 3 EV (+0%)  **Total : 538 \~> 677 (+32%)**  Would you support a reform like this? It doesn’t inherently benefit one party over another, it simply makes votes more equal across states.  In fact, using the 2024 presidential election, under this new system:  Harris has **283** easily locked EV's.  Trump has **275** easily locked EV's.  Swing states hold **119** EV's.";support wyoming rule live wyoming vote carry time weight presidential election live california disparity arise electoral vote ev wyoming represent approximately people ev california represent people think national popular vote determine presidency regardless party benefit common argument city like new york los angeles dominate election hold weight reality voting age population reside large metro area single person metro area vote way remain electorate hold substantial influence electoral college unlikely abolish think adjust well reflect people actually live potential solution wyoming rule propose increase size house representatives representative population ratio align small state currently wyoming adjustment redistribute electoral vote fairly california ev texas ev florida ev rhode island ev vermont ev wyoming ev total support reform like inherently benefit party simply make vote equal state fact presidential election new system harris easily lock ev trump easily lock ev swing state hold ev;Potential_One1;64;0.89;34;2025-01-07 18:23:00;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1hv563u;Liberal;Being a liberal as a man.;Anyone else ever feel like being liberal as a man can be socially disadvantageous? I’m 20 but I’ll meet people from the ages of 16-65 who just seem polarized by the fact that I’m liberal to the point where it becomes an isolating identity. I live in Texas so I understand that my geographic location plays a part in this but I wanted to ask if this is a broader issue beyond red states.   I have conservative friends, one of them being my best friend, but the amount of dudes who are conservative and even tolerate someone with an opposing viewpoint is slim to fucking none.   This all ties into a larger problem with the liberal political position being perceived as “dorky” in some respects. I wish it wasn’t the case as I believe it’s the correct position to hold, but it can be demoralizing when I see men who have a lot of good personality traits that I would want to associate with (Family oriented, Hardworking, Physically active and fit, Active in their communities, etc.) who hold the most surface level regressive political positions. That isn’t to say liberal men CAN’T have these personality traits, but it seems like conservative men tend to have them more. (entirely based on personal experience and not based in any statistical data, correct me if I’m wrong).;liberal man feel like liberal man socially disadvantageous meet people age polarize fact liberal point isolate identity live texas understand geographic location play want ask broad issue red state conservative friend good friend dude conservative tolerate opposing viewpoint slim fuck tie large problem liberal political position perceive dorky respect wish case believe correct position hold demoralize man lot good personality trait want associate family orient hardworking physically active fit active community etc hold surface level regressive political position liberal man personality trait like conservative man tend entirely base personal experience base statistical datum correct wrong;johntwinkle;220;0.82;329;2025-01-06 17:57:01;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1huog2x;Liberal;Putin, Trump, Musk – Who’s the Biggest Threat to the World? Let’s Rank Them;Here’s my take on who poses the greatest threat to the world and why:  3️⃣ Trump – The Easily Manipulated Narcissist  	•	A narcissistic idiot, but the key difference is that he’s not strategic—he just reacts.  	•	Easily influenced by whoever flatters him the most at any given moment.  	•	No real ideology—just self-interest, which makes him unpredictable but also limits his effectiveness.  	•	The danger comes from his enablers (think Bannon, MAGA extremists, and billionaire backers) who use him as a tool.  	•	Would absolutely hand over Ukraine to Putin when he got back in office, just to feel like a “deal maker.”  ⚠️ Threat level: High, but mostly because of the people around him.  2️⃣ Musk – The Tech Billionaire With Too Much  Power   	•	Another narcissistic idiot, but unlike Trump, he actually controls powerful global infrastructure (Starlink, AI, Twitter/X).  	•	Shifts opinions constantly—one day he’s pro-Ukraine, the next he’s practically reciting Kremlin talking points.  	•	Not ideological, just ego-driven—he craves being worshiped and will adapt his views to whatever makes him feel important.  	•	Biggest danger? He owns tools that shape wars, elections yet he’s reckless and impulsive.  🚨 Threat level: Higher than Trump because he has more real-world power and even less accountability.  1️⃣ Putin – The Calculated Threat  	•	Unlike Trump and Musk, Putin is not an idiot—he’s a high-functioning narcissist with a long-term strategy.  	•	He knows exactly what he’s doing and plays the long game with brutality and precision.  	•	Has directly started wars, committed war crimes, and openly threatens nuclear conflict.  	•	Not just a danger to democracy, but to global stability. His entire goal is to destabilize the West so Russia can gain more power.  	•	The most dangerous because he is willing to kill and destroy on a mass scale, and he’s good at it.  ☠️ Threat level: #1 by far. Unlike the other two, he has an actual plan, and it’s terrifying.  Final Ranking of Danger  🥇 1. Putin – Ruthless, intelligent, and willing to burn the world down.  🥈 2. Musk – Reckless, unstable, and dangerously influential.  🥉 3. Trump – Dumb, easily manipulated, and dangerous mostly because of his enablers.

1hq2k2v;Liberal;Questions about symbols, freedom of speech, nationalism;"Apologies in advance for the rant.  For as long as I can remember I've been a big fan of the fact that the the US enshrined free speech in the constitution.  One of the few things I still find to be proud of here, we still mostly let people express themselves how they want.  As such I've also been very wary of people who want to use the power of the government or even social pressure to punish speech and certain kinds of expression that make them feel icky or doesn't agree with whatever they've had on a loop in their heads for the last 60 years.  I find fewer examples of those people scarier than the flag fanatics.  Nationalism has been alive and well in the US for a long time, but it just keeps growing like some kind of swollen, idiocy cancer.  It's frightening because it seems so pervasive, so obviously the opposite of the freedom of the individual that is central to the American ideal, and yet so many of our own citizens are so poorly educated in civics, and basic logic and critical thinking that they don't see the conflict between individual freedom, and laws that regulate speech or even their own insistence that *my* type of expression is protected, but yours isn't.  All over the US, people have American flags on display, all year round, sometimes lots of them.  Flags are fine. They're symbolic communication. It's a symbol of something important to the person who hung it up.  But with the American flag then there are the rules that come with it.  There are a host of them.  All of these rules are fine too.  They are very much like the rules of a religion, or the rules of a certain design esthetic. They may seem arbitrary, nonsensical, or completely superfluous to the uninitiated, but they all serve functions, and, nevertheless, they exist, someone thought of them, wrote them down and others like them. Many people follow these rules.  That is also just fine.  It's when these people insist that everyone else must also follow their flag rules - that is, strict rules about the proper handling of special pieces of colored fabric, we're not talking about organ transplants or unexplored ordinance, here, just nicely decorated cloth - that they have crossed a line.  Why don't they see it?  Your religion says you must do these things and mustn't do those things.  By being a member of that religion, you are following the rules you set down for yourself.  You can't mandate those rules for others.  Are these flag nuts the same people who want to tell me what I can and can't do with my body?   Are they the same people who want public libraries and schools to ban certain books they don't like?  How can they be such proud devotees of ""America"" and completely oblivious to the Incompatability of personal freedom and restrictions on expression?  Some such ""proud Americans"" living near me have said that people who burn the flag in protest should be thrown in prison for life, be physically tortured, raped and killed.  Many agreed.  I suggested that seems like harsh treatment for someone who is destroying a piece of cloth that is not stolen property, and is identical to hundreds of millions of other pieces of cloth like it.  In fact I said it shouldn't be punished at all, and is actually a protected form of expression, ie free speech.  They called me a piece of shit.  Oh they railed at me.  These lunatics crawled out of the woodwork to type in all caps at me because clearly I'm the idiot. And I don't care about that.  Call me an idiot piece of shit, call me a cunt and a whore, call me a nazi or terrorist or whatever.  It's their right to call me whatever because they have the right to free speech.  I'm glad they can call me whatever they want without fear of being arrested for blasphemy or some other medieval bullshit.  But seriously, Who tf are these psychos?  Did no one else listen in 7th grade social studies?  Did none of them make the connection between pride and nationalism, and between censorship and fascism?  I'm so grossly disappointed in all of us.  If you told me when I was that 7th grader (long long time ago now) that our country was this full of morons I wouldn't have believed you.  I think the country's average IQ now has dropped into hypothermic territory, and scarier still is I don't have much hope that we'll ever be able to fix it.  I can't see any path for us to move forward with a populace that is this dumb-as-fuck.  It's not fun to be an average cow in a herd stampedeing toward a cliff, realizing that we're all going to plummet to our deaths if we don't change course, and screaming at the rest of the cattle to turn but your herd mates are all too fucking stupid to listen.  /rant";question symbol freedom speech nationalism apology advance rant long remember big fan fact enshrine free speech constitution thing find proud let people express want wary people want use power government social pressure punish speech certain kind expression feel icky agree loop head year find few example people scary flag fanatic nationalism alive long time keep grow like kind swollen idiocy cancer frightening pervasive obviously opposite freedom individual central american ideal citizen poorly educate civic basic logic critical thinking conflict individual freedom law regulate speech insistence type expression protect people american flag display year round lot flag fine symbolic communication symbol important person hang american flag rule come host rule fine like rule religion rule certain design esthetic arbitrary nonsensical completely superfluous uninitiated serve function exist think write like people follow rule fine people insist follow flag rule strict rule proper handling special piece colored fabric talk organ transplant unexplored ordinance nicely decorate cloth cross line religion say thing thing member religion follow rule set mandate rule flag nut people want tell body people want public library school ban certain book like proud devotee america completely oblivious incompatability personal freedom restriction expression proud americans live near say people burn flag protest throw prison life physically torture rape kill agree suggest like harsh treatment destroy piece cloth steal property identical hundred million piece cloth like fact say punish actually protect form expression ie free speech call piece shit oh rail lunatic crawl woodwork type cap clearly idiot care idiot piece shit cunt whore nazi terrorist right right free speech glad want fear arrest blasphemy medieval bullshit seriously tf psychos listen grade social study connection pride nationalism censorship fascism grossly disappointed tell grader long long time ago country moron believe think country average iq drop hypothermic territory scarier hope able fix path forward populace dumb fuck fun average cow herd stampede cliff realize go plummet death change course scream rest cattle turn herd mate fucking stupid listen;Round_Skill8057;3;0.71;6;2024-12-31 00:52:25;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

I'm sure over the course of the next four years we'll get posts from people who lament their choices this election. I won't have any sympathy. In fact, I'll gladly give them the middle finger.   The writing has been on the walls for months... years even. Harris, to anyone with common sense, was the better candidate. Regardless of the culture war nonsense she was young, had more experience, and smarter than Trump or Biden. She garnered MILLIONS MORE votes than Hillary did against Trump and STILL lost.

He immediately started taunting us and I got kind of nervous. HOWEVER, my partner, who is 2 years HRT, felt like an absolute beast that day. They got up took their beer and flung it in his face. They grabbed my arm and walked out as he screamed F-slurs. And as I sashayed out of that wretched bar  I turned back and did a little spin on my favorite Ironman quote. “I hate you 3000, B***H!” and slammed the door shut.

1h8gk1r;Liberal;I wish people in Idaho, my state, would stop celebrating every time the women's Boise State Volleyball team forfeits a match because their opponent had a transgender athlete on theirs.;I'm so tired of this attitude, like it's somehow a win because a women's university volleyball team forfeited over identity politics and no other reason. It's beyond ridiculous. It does however, give conservatives exactly what they want.  Want to know how? Because when women forfeit matches because of conservatives' perceived enemy everybody loses. Not just the transgender athlete they're attacking, but the women as well. The only people who win in this scenario are conservatives, which is exactly what they want.   I understand that transgender athletes in sports is a controversial issue for a lot of people. But don't suddenly think that because conservatives claim to support women's sports that they're championing their rights by praising them for forfeiting a match over one player.  These are the same people who have no problems denying women rights to their own bodily autonomy.  Sick of this complete clown circus.

1h2pddk;Liberal;Is the problem that the Democratic Party isn't democratic enough?;"I've been thinking. The mission of the Democratic Party from now on should be to break down the 2-party monopoly- *duopoly*? I don't know... Anyway, leadership should fight for ranked choice voting at all levels of government.   They should also fight to get rid of: The filibuster, and the Electoral College (Along with gerrymandering). Fight that Supreme Court Judges get elected through other means other than a sheer presidential selection. I mean - the US is ranked 30-36 in the world democracy index and is deemed a ""Deficient democracy"".       I'm sure they don't want to bite their own tail. But the TRUTH is - You can't be a Democratic Party in a non-Democratic system. I mean, 2 freaking parties in a country of 350 + million people is a complete joke.   Now, a true democratic system is going to be harder to implement because the 2-party paradigm is well baked into the American psyche. But it's absolutely necessary. MAGA should have been its own extreme/fringe movement. But because it has to be 2 and only 2 competing parties, it has swallowed up the Republican Party. And now, the political Overton window has stretched out way further, and they have so much more power than if MAGA were just a third party - and we are all paying for it.      The Right and the Left don't agree on much. But they sure have both fought like hell to keep that duopoly going.

1h257k4;Liberal;A horrifying reality of Trump's 2nd term. NO ONE is safe from p2025. Am I the only one seeing this?;"Can we start to assume that no one this time in the white house will ever be liable for anything anymore so long as their lips are aligned with Trump's asshole and suck whatever comes out?  No one on his Legion of Doom will ever have consequences for their actions until they devour themselves for power over whatever is left standing when they are done using anyone that goes against them for slave labor.  I've been calling this game MAGAtes and p2025 have laid out for years.. but I need to run it by other liberals that can be objective and tell me I'm not right. I hope I'm not.  If you can follow this logic and have any decent memory of events in the past 3 Republican terms, you might feel like this is an actually real scenario... If I'm way off on something please call me out. I'm not saying this will be exact, but that the end result will be the same regardless of the how's and when's.  We won't have mass deportation like he's saying but there will be laws that ramp up justice arm's power to get rid of and imprison people here slowly over time .. which eventually through p2025 can fall on ANYONE they decide they wish to detain or get rid of.. even US born citizens. They will have the power to decide unilaterally and disregard civil rights and due process.  It will start with the undocumented immigrants they locate.. then find people who are expendable or have criminal records, people with addictions or that have had govt assistance, down to people that just aren't ""American"" enough, dangers or non-patriots.. they will be rounded up to be ""reformed."" They'll use camps for these people and work their way down the list until you have his side, and those suffering doing Chinese/gulag/gestapo-style govt labor to achieve forever power and control over us. You can change the terms and methods but let's assume they can do what they want, because they have everything they need now to do so.  Think it's crazy? Conspiracy? Yeah I get it but sometimes we see things before they happen and never listen to the ones who warned us. But it's all in the 2025 playbook and we've been here before. This time only the people can stop it, but that won't happen when we're scared and shut in our homes asking for help, saying yeah but not MY family right?  All they need to do is what I've been saying for years, declare another seemingly needed, but ultimately bullshit ""war..""   I think this time it will be the ""war on immigration"" or something so they can make up emergency war time acts/laws.. just like the war on terror. Which was how we got the patriot act..  remember that? Civil liberties trampled on, privacy violated. We were scared, so they were allowed to quell our fears, but what they were really doing was not targeted at terror and our enemies, but at Americans themselves.   People are scared again, and just like COVID you get rich by causing a problem and selling the solution. This time I truly feel like they're going to take everything from us.. and what I fear more is that they know we can't sustain our population anymore, and they intend to close ranks, save themselves, and watch the rest of us slowly fade into genocidal memory.

1h0ovd0;Liberal; Democrats that said they don't vote because they live in an area that's always red, and their vote doesn't matter. ;"**About 86 million eligible voters didn’t vote in the last election.**  If you're one of them that didn’t vote because you feel like your voice doesn’t matter, I’m not here to blame or attack you. It’s easy to feel powerless in a system that often feels stacked against us. My point is simple: you matter more than you might think. Even if your candidate doesn’t win, when you show up, others in your community will see they’re not alone. Maybe your vote could inspire them to show up next time.  Let’s take a closer look at why every vote matters, even in areas perceived as overwhelmingly red.  # Example 1: [Glascock County, Georgia](https://results.sos.ga.gov/results/public/glascock-county-ga/elections/2024NovGen)  * **Registered voters:** 2,073 * **Turnout:** 81% (1,682 ballots cast) * **Didn’t vote:** 391    * **Trump:** 1,534 (91.86%)    * **Kamala Harris:** 133 (7.96%)  Even if all 391 non-voters had shown up and voted for Kamala, giving her **524 votes**, Trump still would have won. In counties like these, it’s easy to feel like voting is futile.  # Example 2: [Baker County, Georgia](https://results.sos.ga.gov/results/public/baker-county-ga/elections/2024NovGen)  * **Registered voters:** 2,066 * **Turnout:** 72% (1,486 ballots cast) * **Didn’t vote:** 580    * **Trump:** 883 (59.82%)    * **Kamala Harris:** 590 (39.97%)  If just **444 of the 580 non-voters** had shown up and voted for Kamala, she would have won. It’s not impossible to imagine enough of those remaining voters choosing Kamala to secure the win.  Even if your candidate doesn’t win, increasing turnout changes perceptions. For example, in Glascock County, **1534 vs. 524** sends a stronger message than **1534 vs. 133.** It shows Democrats have local support, making progressive voices less isolated. This visibility can energize communities, spark deeper discussions, and even sway centrists or independents in future elections.  It’s not lost on me that counties are part of larger congressional districts, where votes across multiple counties determine outcomes for House seats and electoral votes. For example, there’s an entire section of Georgia that voted blue in the last election but turned red in this one. If just one county in that area turns blue again, it could create a ripple effect, shifting the district’s votes back to blue in future elections.  Every vote contributes to a bigger picture—it’s not just about winning today, but about shaping tomorrow’s outcomes.  The one thing I want you to take from this: You matter.  Disclaimer: This 86 million estimate only includes those who were eligible to vote.

1gyvcys;Liberal;Why do we always have to pretend as though we win every time we start to lose?;"These past few years I can't stand watching liberal and left-wing news or news content creators. By no means have I come anywhere close to giving up or falling for right-wing conspiratorial to outright false talking points, but I can't stand it anymore. I watch MSNBC and the reactions are always the same. Either shock that Trump or his supporters said something, smugness over right wing hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, or stern scolding to people who aren't watching. And then we act and treat this as a win when Trump supporters don't care. They never will because they already believe that every negative thing about him is fake, if he does do anything he said he wouldn't do it's the right choice or a ploy, and that if what he said doesn't work-out he was misled or sabotage. We act like we haven't been dealing with these people for years. Trump and his supports will never accept a loss even as they are eating the rotten discarded remains.  Even when we do win it's not like they care anyways. I just saw a video about how Trump said the egg prices would go down before he even took office (because of course he is the darn tootenist gosh golly thing to touch the economy since overspeculation, buying on margin, and high variable interest rates) and while I care that eggs are still expensive, I stopped listening to Trumps boasting a long time ago. Trump supporters are still blaming Biden, and they'll continue blame him and other democrats as long as they possibly can. We act like people aren't treating us as villains for cutting out trump supporting family members and friends even though they'll pretend that their crowd has never done that. I can't be brought to care if you cut trump supporters out, by all means it might make your life better, but we act like it's only been a good thing for liberals and democrats.   I talk to Trump supporters, both in my family and workplace. They haven't ""fallen besides themselves"" since Matt Gaetz withdrew, they see it as either an operation to remove democratic/rhino opposition to Trump's next appointee or as Gaetz willingly and nobly stepping to the side so that the ""Democrat psy-op"" and ""Forged accusations"" won't distract from Trump's next term. We know that handing them the receipts won't convince them because they will have forgotten to read. When they do happen to get a win, we default to talking about our wins that they don't care about, and it just comes across as though we're living in a fantasy land. It's like we're trying to emulate them but somehow missed the point of why they behave like they do.  I don't want us to give up and admit defeat. I just want us to stop pretending as though every little thing that happens is a win.

Google has proven themselves somewhat unreliable, given their response to a California bill asking them to foot some of the bill for journalism schooling using some of their massive profits (they said they would throttle CA news results in searches.) Currently, I look at Apple News, BBC, AP news apps, but I believe these are all aggregates, and I expect mainstream news to be corrupted or censored soon.

1gxdeh1;Liberal;United by Conservative hate;I work blue collar in a deep red state.  So most of the people I deal with on a daily basis are maga.  Lots of people on my facebook are maga.  So this morning I was looking through facebook and there was a post about the 10 Greatest Athletes of all time.  These posts are usually stupid.  How the hell are you going to pick a top 10 out of so many sports.  We can’t even decide on a top 10 in one position of a single sport but we are going to pick one for all sports?  Anyway, the list had people like Pele and Gretzky and Ali and of course LeBron James.  There is no way to unite conservative, white, males, quite like their hatred for LeBron James.  I know men who haven’t watched a game since Jordan was in his prime but every one of them hates LeBron.  “THIS ISN’T ABOUT HIS POLITICS!!!  HE IS OVERRATED AND RUINING THE GAME!”  Yes, it is about politics.  I know because you don’t watch basketball and don’t give a shit about the game but you have very strong feelings about a player that you have never watched play.  It’s like the Kaitlyn Clark/Angel Reese thing.  Want to rile up a white, conservative, woman?  Just tell them you think Reese is a good player.  You don’t even need to mention Clark.  Just complimenting Reese is enough.  My mother has went to hundreds of sporting events to watch her children and grandchildren play various sports.  She couldn’t tell you how the points work in any sport besides maybe Soccer.  She spent 35 years living with a die hard Bears fan and she asked me the other day if I thought the Cubs might make the Super Bowl this year.  But bring up Clark and it’s all “Oh I love her, she plays with class!”  What the fuck does that even mean?  She once told me that Reese only gets the points because she is rebounding her own missed shots.  This woman doesn’t even know what a rebound is.  The whole Bird/Magic thing was a little before my time, was it like this back then?   I say all this because this is why the fight is so hard.  Conservatives are united in their hatred.  United against the libtards and the gay agenda and the war on Christmas and against Wokeness.  Their hatred unites them like nothing units the Left.  On the Left we have different views.  We are united about gun control but we have different views on how to get that done.  We are united on saving the planet from global warming yet we have different views on how to get that done.  Police reform, abortion, public schools, unions, race relations, we are all united in the ideas yet the minutia differs.  Conservative hate though…Trump says hate like this and they hate like this.  Fox News says hate like this and they hate like this.  They are united, and I honestly, have no idea how to fight that. ;unite conservative hate work blue collar deep red state people deal daily basis maga lot people facebook maga morning look facebook post great athletes time post usually stupid hell go pick sport decide position single sport go pick sport list people like pele gretzky ali course lebron james way unite conservative white male like hatred lebron james know man watch game jordan prime hate lebron politics overrated ruin game yes politic know watch basketball shit game strong feeling player watch play like kaitlyn clark angel reese thing want rile white conservative woman tell think reese good player need mention clark compliment reese mother go hundred sporting event watch child grandchild play sport tell point work sport maybe soccer spend year live die hard bears fan ask day think cubs super bowl year bring clark oh love play class fuck mean tell reese get point rebound miss shot woman know rebound bird magic thing little time like fight hard conservative unite hatred united libtard gay agenda war christmas wokeness hatred unite like unit left left different view unite gun control different view unite save planet global warming different view police reform abortion public school union race relation unite idea minutia differ conservative hate trump say hate like hate like fox news say hate like hate like united honestly idea fight;theblueowlisdead;169;0.89;68;2024-11-22 17:35:16;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

The general consensus was that they were still prices of shit, but they were at least pieces of shit that followed reason to some degree  However, the democrats of today is something I’m familiar with. I want to know what it meant to be a democrat say 60 years ago.  There were still Americans fighting for equal rights. There’s always charts showing how long women have had to wait to file for divorce, own a house, have their own bank account. Really basic shit that could never get taken away today.  What were democrats fighting for/against 60 years ago?   As a tangent, I just want to remind everyone how far we’ve come. Nixon got 49 states and almost double the amount of votes than McGovern. America was pure red, and yes, the republican back then was different than today  But gay people can marry who they want, it’s been than way for almost 10 years. Trans people have more opportunity to be who they are than ever before. Women unfortunately suffered a huge loss in 2022, and still aren’t quite there yet in other ways. But have much more rights than women did 60 years ago.  That’s how far we’ve come. Trump and his little clique are most likely going to do some shit, shit that will undo years of work to equalize America. But like Ms. Harris said, we are not going back.

1gv3l0j;Liberal;What were republicans like before Trump? TLDR at the bottom;I was 2 years old when W Bush was reelected in 2004, so I never paid much attention to politics obviously. Hell, I’m sure that even when I was 6 I probably didn’t know Obama was president for a long while. But I knew he was president as some point and obviously he’s amazing  But 2016 rolls around and Donald Trump comes into the picture. I was rooting for Hilary, but ultimately at that point in my life, it didn’t affect me that much so him winning was not a big deal. And tbh I don’t even know when I started to get into politics, because I voted for Biden in 2020 but that year was such a blur that I don’t even know how I felt.  But I think it must start in 2022 when the Supreme Court overturned Roe V Wade. I looked into what caused it, and found out it was trump and his justice picks. That’s when it really started. I began looking briefly at some of his campaign in 2016 and just seeing the lying, pretentious, pos he really is.   But I ultimately didn’t pay that much attention. I figured if Biden won once, then he could win again. But we all know how that turned out.  I was so excited to see Kamala Harris running. I truly believed Trump’s cult was dying out, evident by his loss in 2020, that there was no way he’d win. This election would be a slam dunk and a retribution of the 2016 election. So for all 107 days of her campaign as well as every day since, I’ve kept a close eye on the him, with each new rally and piece of misinformation further cementing my hatred of him and his dumbass followers  The fucking insult to injury is that he doesn’t even fucking campaign. He talks about literally nothing for hours and people eat it up. In a normal world his campaign would’ve ended so many times. Need I remind you that this made jacked off a microphone and pretended to suck it? Fucking hell.  I’ve never gotten to experience it because literally 76 million people voted for him and all of them are usually batshit crazy.  Because it seems like from an ideological standpoint no republican or democrat should ever get along? But the two party system is apparently so integral to the backbone of the country that we just have to push against each other for eternity?  So TLDR: now that I’m making the effort to remain informed for probably the rest of my life, I have to know, what were republicans like in the first 15 years of the new Millennium? ;republicans like trump tldr year old w bush reelect pay attention politic obviously hell sure probably know obama president long know president point obviously amazing roll donald trump come picture root hilary ultimately point life affect win big deal tbh know start politic vote biden year blur know feel think start supreme court overturn roe v wade look cause find trump justice pick start begin look briefly campaign see lie pretentious pos ultimately pay attention figure biden win win know turn excited kamala harris run truly believe trump cult die evident loss way win election slam dunk retribution election day campaign day keep close eye new rally piece misinformation cement hatred dumbass follower fucking insult injury fuck campaign talk literally hour people eat normal world campaign end time need remind jack microphone pretend suck fucking hell get experience literally million people vote usually batshit crazy like ideological standpoint republican democrat party system apparently integral backbone country push eternity tldr make effort remain informed probably rest life know republicans like year new millennium;RenziumZ;38;0.74;83;2024-11-19 18:04:40;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0
1guzzlj;Liberal;Social Darwinist Oligarchs are a bigger threat than Christian Nationalists right now;"It seems clear to me that a subset of the ultra-wealthy may actually want American society to collapse, paving the way for a techno-autocracy where oligarchs rule. A key text influencing this ideology appears to be *The Sovereign Individual,* written in the late 1990s by William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson. The book didn’t merely predict the disruptions that information technology would bring—it embraced them, rooting for a future where inequality, competition, and instability would dominate.  The authors envisioned a world where governments crumble, taxes vanish, and welfare states become “unfinanceable.” In their harsh vision, only the ""sovereign individual""—a self-reliant, technologically adept elite—would thrive. As *The Guardian* put it:  [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans)  >“By 2010 or thereabouts, welfare states ‘will simply become unfinanceable.’ … In such a harsh world, only the most talented, self-reliant, technologically adept person – ‘the sovereign individual’ – would thrive.”  The book gained little traction in late-1990s Britain, dismissed as melodramatic and out of touch with the era’s optimism. But it found a warmer reception in the U.S., particularly among Silicon Valley libertarians. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, cited *The Sovereign Individual* as one of the most influential books in his life, praising its startlingly accurate predictions about cryptocurrency, digital identities, and even bots. As Rees-Mogg and Davidson predicted:  >“\[A\] ‘new digital form of money’ \[would\] consist of encrypted sequences … unique, anonymous and verifiable … tradable at a keystroke in a multitrillion-dollar wholesale market without borders.”  Sound familiar? Bitcoin arrived a decade later.  Thiel, however, doesn’t just buy into techno-libertarianism, he’s also wrestled publicly with Christianity’s role in shaping ""wokeness."" In an interview reported by *Mediaite*, Thiel said:  [https://www.mediaite.com/news/billionaire-gop-donor-peter-thiel-blames-christianity-for-wokeness-it-always-takes-the-side-of-the-victim/](https://www.mediaite.com/news/billionaire-gop-donor-peter-thiel-blames-christianity-for-wokeness-it-always-takes-the-side-of-the-victim/)  >“Christianity ... always takes the side of the victim. … Maybe you should think of wokeness as ultra-Christianity or hyper-Christianity. It’s an extreme intensification. … The past is terrible, and you can never overcome it.”  Thiel seems to see ""wokeness"" as a kind of mutated Christianity—focused on sin, victimhood, and moral judgment without forgiveness.  This leaves us in a precarious spot. Christian nationalism, with its regressive social agenda, is troubling enough. But a future shaped by social Darwinists like Thiel—who see safety nets and compassion as obstacles—could be even darker. Right now, both forces seem to be jockeying for influence over “Weekend at Trumpy’s,” with the likes of Elon Musk and Thiel cozying up to Trump in ways Christian Nationalists can only dream of.  Whichever side wins the most influence, the rest of us stand to lose.  Christian nationalism is a plague, but if social darwinists take control, things will get truly dark IMO. They want the destruction of any and all social safety nets.  The difference is that rightwing Christians want the Church to provide the safety net, not the government. The government is perceived as a threat to their power and ability to provide that, even if churches only provide a minimal safety net on their terms, and are often designed in ways to enhance their authority and can be exploitive.  Whereas social darwinists literally don't want social safety nets at all... they want survival of the fittest.";social darwinist oligarchs big threat christian nationalists right clear subset ultra wealthy actually want american society collapse pave way techno autocracy oligarch rule key text influence ideology appear sovereign individual write late william rees mogg james dale davidson book merely predict disruption information technology bring embrace root future inequality competition instability dominate author envision world government crumble taxis vanish welfare state unfinanceable harsh vision sovereign self reliant technologically adept elite thrive guardian thereabout welfare state simply unfinanceable harsh world talented self reliant technologically adept person sovereign individual thrive book gain little traction britain dismiss melodramatic touch era optimism find warm reception particularly silicon valley libertarian peter thiel co founder paypal cite sovereign individual influential book life praise startlingly accurate prediction cryptocurrency digital identity bot rees mogg davidson predict new digital form money consist encrypt sequence unique anonymous verifiable tradable keystroke multitrillion dollar wholesale market border sound familiar bitcoin arrive decade later thiel buy techno libertarianism wrestle publicly christianity role shape wokeness interview report mediaite thiel say christianity take victim maybe think wokeness ultra christianity hyper christianity extreme intensification past terrible overcome thiel wokeness kind mutated christianity focus sin victimhood moral judgment forgiveness leave precarious spot christian nationalism regressive social agenda troubling future shape social darwinists like thiel safety net compassion obstacle dark right force jockey influence weekend trumpy like elon musk thiel cozye trump way christian nationalists dream whichever win influence rest stand lose christian nationalism plague social darwinist control thing truly dark imo want destruction social safety net difference rightwe christians want church provide safety net government government perceive threat power ability provide church provide minimal safety net term design way enhance authority exploitive social darwinist literally want social safety net want survival fit;ShaneKaiGlenn;78;0.94;32;2024-11-19 15:38:27;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1gujrx2;Liberal;AI's Solution to the 2024/2028 Election;"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens.  I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help.  I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here.  Sorry if this breaks some sub rule.  Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.""  The response:  ""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do: 1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency      The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.     The Solution:         Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").         Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.         Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction, we're focused on [core theme].""  2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically      The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true.     The Solution:         Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.         Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.         Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.  3. Humanize the Campaign      The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.     The Solution:         Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.         Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.  4. Leverage Data and Analytics      The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.     The Solution:         Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.         Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.  5. Strengthen Institutional Trust      The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.     The Solution:         Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness, instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.         Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.  6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""      The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.     The Solution:         Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").         Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.  7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism      The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.     The Solution:         Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.         Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.  8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk      The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.     The Solution:         Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.         For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""  By sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.""";ai solution election like maga gop gullible citizen loss counter strategy constant lying go ai help think response interesting strategy copy sorry break sub rule question recently donald trump republican candidate win election kamala harris democratic candidate tell win spout impossible number lie effectively unchallengable sheer number allow follower pick choose thing want believe opponent pick stance stick chastise use logical mathematical mind determine kamala harris future democratic candidate successfully counter strategy response counter strategy build overwhelming volume misinformation narrative control require structured multi layered approach address dynamic truth human psychology logical breakdown kamala harris future democratic candidate prioritize narrative simplicity consistency problem avalanche lie overwhelming exploit cognitive bias simplicity lie resonate exist bias easy people remember solution develop core theme resonate emotionally easily repeatable work american use repetition create cognitive stickiness appearance speech media opportunity circle core theme frame response attack narrative example distraction focused core theme use selective fact checking strategically problem counter lie lead fatigue illusory truth effect repetition make lie true solution choose debunk high impact lie cause measurable harm derail core message use truth sandwich approach start truth briefly debunk lie return truth collaborate trust medium fact check platform preemptively debunk repeat falsehood humanize campaign problem broadly target lie thrive lack specific emotional grounding solution focus individual story human connection highlight real people policy affect directly deploy surrogate trust community voice politician amplify story refute misinformation circle leverage data analytics problem lie spread emotionally engaging target digital campaign solution employ micro target ad reach key demographic message tailor counter misinformation specific contexts monitor misinformation trend ai analytic tool identify counter viral narrative quickly strengthen institutional trust problem lie undermine trust institution make easy false narrative thrive solution position campaign force institutional renewal reform avoid defensiveness instead advocate transparency accountability partner trusted non political organization communicate key message flood lies problem people notice volume strategy misinformation explicitly point solution introduce concept lie overload public discourse use humor metaphor try drink truth firehose lie highlight pattern dishonesty individual claim frame disrespectful voter emphasize unity forward look optimism problem lie create polarization fear motivate voter cling familiar narrative solution offer vision positive inclusive solution orient use optimistic messaging contrast chaos divisiveness sow misinformation pre bunk debunk problem lie hold meet people unprepared solution anticipate likely misinformation theme preemptively address fact frame gain traction example false claim taxis emerge emphasize ensure tax fairness work family billionaire pay share stick strategy democratic candidate navigate challenge misinformation heavy campaign maintain integrity effectiveness ultimately goal frame campaign advocate truth solution react falsehood;neepster44;53;0.84;19;2024-11-19 00:06:51;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

So, these people know exactly what they're doing. They're making a choice. It's high time they learn that their choices have consequences.       This might come off as an unpopular opinion. But I do think the only way to get people to come back to their senses is to let them see and feel, to the fullest extent, the consequences of their actions. Democrats should vote 100% with Trump -  or at least abstain. For one, allow stupid people like Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. If democrats try to build up some kind of opposition now, the public will just blame them for not allowing Trump to land his agenda.   Democrats literally have nothing to lose. Their coalition is fractured. Anything done right under Trump will only allow Trump to get the credit - and will further justify the choice of the electorate.

But conservatives have constantly gaslit people into claiming it wasn't about racism that they were mad about DEI, but because the candidates weren't qualified while they provided no proof.  Yet here comes their Orange God Trump. The piece of shit is appointing pedophiles as AG and incompetent news hosts as Secretary of Defense. What's the opinions of conservatives? Crickets. I mean, I suppose the conservative sub might be upset at the Gaetz pick, but don't think it's because they've suddenly grown a conscience, it's only because he makes them look bad. They couldn't give a shit about his crimes.   So I don't want to hear a single conservative cry to me about DEI and how unfair it is when their fucking orange cheeto that couldn't bench a nut or outrun a tortoise is appointing conspiracy theorists and meme lords to run our government.

1gssfap;Liberal;Yes, There is a Difference between Liberal and Conservative Brains (It's the Amygdala);"Dozens of studies have been done on the difference between liberal and conservative brains with MRI imaging all over the world - and the word they've coined for it is: ""Neural Partisanship"". Multiple research studies show that Conservatives have a slightly larger amygdala - the brain’s emotion and fear processing center. The difference is small - but has large impact on how Conservatives see the world. This slight enlargement makes Conservatives more reactive to what they perceive as ""threats"". (This is not to say there are not other factors, life experiences, that influence them. But neurobiology provides a framework about our predisposition to certain positions.  The amygdala is also responsible for gearing ""flight/fight"" responses under the influence of the cortisol produced by the adrenal glands. Most of these studies were done by linking participants to MRI machines and observing their neural reactions. Some researchers got so good at interpreting the data that they could tell if a person leaned Liberal or Conservative just by observing how neural pathways lit up during the session.   The amygdala acts like the brain’s alarm system for everyone. When it detects a threat, it springs into action, triggering our fight-or-flight response. In the context of anger, the amygdala is often the first to sound the alarm, setting off a cascade of emotional and physiological responses.  Change is often perceived as a threat and is a stressor for many people, but for Conservatives it's something to which they are very sensitive. Their response to a perceived threat will typically be greater than a Liberal brain.   **Cue the media.**   Conservatives don't typically leave their news ""bubble"" - they watch Fox, OAN, NewMax, and others. who feed them fear-mongering news in a continuous stream which often generates fear and anxiety. (They don't call it ""rage media"" for nothing.) Being fed ""threats"" - to themselves, their families and their country -  24/7 leads to high cortisol production 24/7. Essentially, all this means  is that their brains are marinated in fear, anxiety and that they will often respond to threats with anger, rather than a reasoned consideration of the issue.  **\[On a personal note, it is absolutely amazing how triggered Conservatives get when you give them this information. I was called a ""moron"" and ""bitch"" by one man who then went on to quote Scripture talking about how Jesus approved of ""war"". I was invited to ""go outside and have my face punched in"" -  just in the last few days...so  - apparently even having a discussion about the source of their political orientation produces a rage reaction in them. Seriously over the top anger...\]**  The following are additional notes from the studies in no particular order - and they explain so much when we look at the predispositions of Conservatives and Liberals.  ""One interesting study found that, compared to liberals, conservatives show a ""larger volume of gray matter in the right amygdala (rAMG), a region that plays a critical role in the processing of negative, aversive human emotions like sadness, fear, and threat, and less gray matter in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region linked to error monitoring, belief updating, and affect-regulation.”  ""Liberals and conservatives differ in their neural interpretations of political concepts.""  ""Conservatives are worse at distinguishing truths and falsehoods than liberals.""  ""Conservatives have greater psychological resilience attributable to greater impulse control and causal reasoning.""  ""Conservatives, compared to liberals, see scientific and non-scientific viewpoints as closer in legitimacy."" (Note: In other words, if your medical doctors tells you one thing about your medical condition, and the guy you're sitting next to in the casino tells you something different...Conservatives are more likely to give them both the same weight. Anyone remember COVID?)  ""Liberals show greater cognitive flexibility than conservatives, meaning they have a greater ability to appropriately and efficiently adjust their behavior according to a changing environment.“  ""In moral judgments, conservatives emphasize value of actions, while liberals emphasize value of expected outcome.""  ""Liberals solve problems more via insight than step-by-step analysis.""  ""Conservatives give more weight to negative information than positive information, compared with liberals.""  ""Individual political attitudes correlate with physiological traits, such as sensitivity to sudden noises and threatening visual images.""  ""When faced with a conflict, liberals are more likely than conservatives to alter their habitual response when cues indicate it is necessary.""  ""Liberals focus on the future more than the past, while conservatives focus on the past more than the future.""  ""Conservatives and liberals react similarly to positive incentives, but conservatives have greater sensitivity to negative stimuli.""  ""Reliance on quick, efficient, and “low effort” thought processes yields conservative ideologies, while effortful and deliberate reasoning yields liberal ideologies.""  **What does this mean for the future?**  Well, we need to acknowledge that they don't have a lot of control over their biological fear/anxiety responses. But they are still responsible for their language and behavior. They are riding high right now - but it is incredibly difficult to have a discussion with someone who is kept in a heightened state of fear and rage - and who can't break their addiction to right-wing media.   I wish I had more answers, but for now, if we can just understand some of their physiological responses and understanding how their brains react - it will be a step in the right direction. Stop trying to reason, argue, discuss, point out harm, economic disaster, etc. They don't even hear it. They just perceive those as ""Liberal threats"", become angry and you will have accomplished nothing except raising your own blood pressure.  \+++++++++++++  All of these discussions and citations to the individual study can be found here -      [https://amarkfoundation.org/reports/how-are-the-brains-of-liberals-and-conservatives-different-update/](https://amarkfoundation.org/reports/how-are-the-brains-of-liberals-and-conservatives-different-update/)  ";yes difference liberal conservative brains amygdala dozen study difference liberal conservative brain mri imaging world word coin neural partisanship multiple research study conservative slightly large amygdala brain emotion fear processing center difference small large impact conservative world slight enlargement make conservative reactive perceive threat factor life experience influence neurobiology provide framework predisposition certain position amygdala responsible gear flight fight response influence cortisol produce adrenal gland study link participant mri machine observe neural reaction researcher get good interpret datum tell person lean liberal conservative observe neural pathway light session amygdala act like brain alarm system detect threat spring action trigger fight flight response context anger amygdala sound alarm set cascade emotional physiological response change perceive threat stressor people conservative sensitive response perceive threat typically great liberal brain cue medium conservative typically leave news bubble watch fox oan newmax feed fear monger news continuous stream generate fear anxiety rage medium feed threat family country lead high cortisol production essentially mean brain marinate fear anxiety respond threat anger reason consideration issue personal note absolutely amazing trigger conservative information call moron bitch man go quote scripture talk jesus approve war invite outside face punch day apparently have discussion source political orientation produce rage reaction seriously anger follow additional note study particular order explain look predisposition conservatives liberals interesting study find compare liberal conservative large volume gray matter right amygdala ramg region play critical role processing negative aversive human emotion like sadness fear threat gray matter anterior cingulate cortex acc region link error monitoring belief updating affect regulation liberal conservative differ neural interpretation political concept conservative bad distinguish truth falsehood liberal conservative great psychological resilience attributable great impulse control causal reasoning conservative compare liberal scientific non scientific viewpoint close legitimacy note word medical doctor tell thing medical condition guy sit casino tell different conservative likely weight remember covid liberal great cognitive flexibility conservative mean great ability appropriately efficiently adjust behavior accord change environment moral judgment conservative emphasize value action liberal emphasize value expect outcome liberal solve problem insight step step analysis conservative weight negative information positive information compare liberal individual political attitude correlate physiological trait sensitivity sudden noise threaten visual image face conflict liberal likely conservative alter habitual response cue indicate necessary liberal focus future past conservative focus past future conservative liberal react similarly positive incentive conservative great sensitivity negative stimulus reliance quick efficient low effort thought process yield conservative ideology effortful deliberate reasoning yield liberal ideology mean future need acknowledge lot control biological fear anxiety response responsible language behavior ride high right incredibly difficult discussion keep heighten state fear rage break addiction right wing medium wish answer understand physiological response understand brain react step right direction stop try reason argue discuss point harm economic disaster etc hear perceive liberal threat angry accomplish raise blood pressure discussion citation individual study find;progressiveprepper;54;0.9;32;2024-11-16 17:36:09;NA;0
1gsoomx;Liberal;Elon Musk's Experiment in Chaos;Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was a corporate melodrama of hubris and miscalculation. Forced into the $44 billion deal after an ill-fated public declaration of interest—and a subsequent legal entanglement—Musk found himself trapped. The deal drained a substantial portion of his wealth, publicly tethered him to a troubled platform, and bruised his reputation. Tesla, the crown jewel of his empire, saw its stock dip as investors questioned his judgment and priorities. To many, the world's richest man now seemed outmaneuvered, exposed, and mocked on the very platform he now owned.  But Musk, a man who thrives on reinvention, channeled his humiliation into calculated revenge—not just against those who mocked him, but against the entire system he saw as flawed and hypocritical. If the acquisition of Twitter had turned him into a global punchline, he would reshape the punchline into a weapon.  Over time, the platform transformed under his guidance—chaotic, polarizing, and riddled with policy decisions that seemed less about business strategy and more about dismantling cultural norms. Musk's motivations became inscrutable, but one pattern emerged: he sought to amplify voices that promised upheaval, regardless of their political orientation. He reconnected with figures like Donald Trump, whose populist appeal and chaotic energy mirrored Musk’s own ethos of disruption.  It wasn’t ideological. Musk didn’t care about partisan divides, he cared about breaking the status quo. America had humiliated him, and now he would humiliate America. In funding Trump’s political resurgence, Musk wasn’t endorsing a candidate—he was creating a spectacle. His millions flowed into the campaign not to champion a cause but to watch the world’s most powerful democracy devour itself.  Kamala Harris wasn’t defeated by Donald Trump. She was outmaneuvered by Elon Musk’s shadowy influence. Musk’s resources, his platform, and his vendetta shaped the electoral landscape. The election wasn’t just a contest of ideologies, it was a stage for Musk’s experiment in chaos.  As the dust settled, Musk stood apart, watching a world he had pushed toward the brink. Was it revenge, sociopathy, or the perverse thrill of proving that even the most powerful systems could be puppets to his whims? Musk’s actions defied easy categorization, but the consequences were clear: he wasn’t just a tech mogul anymore. He had become something else entirely—a kingmaker, a chaos agent, a man whose wounds fueled his quest to reshape the world in his image.  And for those who had once mocked him, that was the cruelest irony of all.;elon musk experiment chaos elon musk acquisition twitter corporate melodrama hubris miscalculation force billion deal ill fate public declaration interest subsequent legal entanglement musk find trap deal drain substantial portion wealth publicly tether troubled platform bruise reputation tesla crown jewel empire see stock dip investor question judgment priority world rich man outmaneuver expose mock platform own musk man thrive reinvention channel humiliation calculated revenge mock entire system see flawed hypocritical acquisition twitter turn global punchline reshape punchline weapon time platform transform guidance chaotic polarizing riddle policy decision business strategy dismantle cultural norm musk motivation inscrutable pattern emerge seek amplify voice promise upheaval regardless political orientation reconnecte figure like donald trump populist appeal chaotic energy mirror musk ethos disruption ideological musk care partisan divide care break status quo america humiliate humiliate america fund trump political resurgence musk endorse candidate create spectacle million flow campaign champion cause watch world powerful democracy devour kamala harris defeat donald trump outmaneuver elon musk shadowy influence musk resource platform vendetta shape electoral landscape election contest ideology stage musk experiment chaos dust settle musk stand apart watch world push brink revenge sociopathy perverse thrill prove powerful system puppet whim musk action defy easy categorization consequence clear tech mogul anymore entirely kingmaker chaos agent man wound fuel quest reshape world image mock cruel irony;StayAtHomePlantDaddy;46;0.72;36;2024-11-16 14:42:45;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

I gave the American people way too much credit. But we’re here, and the horrors have already started at an alarming rate.  I am posting this from the perspective of someone who grew up Republican and was a Republican staffer on the Hill. I’ve spent time in these spaces. Long story short- it was a long conversion process, but I went from an old school Romney/McCain type to someone who is comfortably just as leftist as AOC. However, that journey has brought me to a place where I’m increasingly infuriated that the Dems don’t seem to fully understand their enemy, nor have they demonstrated the grit needed in a moment like this.  I truly believe we are at a critical moment where the coming months could decide our fate for the rest of our lives. That fat orange fuck has vowed to reshape our country into something none of us would recognize. AND YET- Kamala conceded with barely a peep (despite some actual concerning anomalies imo), Biden is teeheeing with tangerine Hitler in the Oval Office, Warren is TWEETING about how Ol’ Donny Boy broke the law again (he’s a felon??? That’s what criminals do??? HELLO??) and NO ONE seems to be calling for the type of drastic action or leadership that is needed right now. The Republicans are stabbing us to death, and the Dems are handwringing about whether it’s ethical to punch back because “we don’t want to be like them.”  Which brings me to this: if we are to survive, if our home is to survive, we need to somehow find the means to start fighting dirty. And I’m dead fucking serious when I say we actually need a blue MAGA movement. A blue tea party movement. Activists and candidates who are populist, loud, and willing to throw every fucking dirty trick the Republicans have done over the last decade *right back in their faces.*   I’m talking candidates who insult their opponents and attack establishment Dems on a level not yet seen before. Activists who go to elected official offices with the pure intent of creating click bait content to feed our base. Podcasters who make that little Shitler Nick Fuentes and that bald idiot Rogan look tame. A multi prong, ruthless approach, with the end goal of making the Dems cower like the MAGA fuckers cucked the Republicans. And none of this fucking infighting- everyone falls in line. Everyone supports the movement. If you don’t, you’re fair game too.   Our country, *our home* is in danger. We need to organize and act accordingly. We need to be as ruthless and dirty and cutthroat as the Republicans have been for years. Fuck your moral high ground. Fuck your norms.

1goxogz;Liberal;What I think needs changing;"Some quick thoughts on what I think needs changing:  * Dems need to focus on concrete solutions, and abandon all of the feelings and vibes nonsense.  I could hear it in almost every speech the last 4 years.  Dripping with feelings and warm fuzzies. Just stop.  Propose long-term solutions, or don't even try.  The vast majority of Americans want problem solving, not an emotional bath.  ""A, B, and C are problems, and we think X, Y, and Z will address at least some of it, and here's how, and here's how it gets paid for."" * DEAL WITH THE BORDER.  I used to think the greatest unforced political error in history was Romney's ""my message is for you, not the 47% of Americans that don't pay taxes.""  Not anymore.  Escorting millions of border crossers into red border states - who then bussed them to blue cities and suburbs -  is now the greatest unforced political error that the free world will ever see. * Stop marching dudes with mustaches, red lipstick, and dresses in front of voters. I believe most folks don't care what the individual does with their own time, but for the love of god, don't alienate voters like you did.  That was another unforced political error. * Never again make the mistake of pigeon-holing the other candidate as a nazi or a felon, without proving to voters beyond a shadow of a doubt that your vision of governance (taxation, foreign policy, economic growth measures, etc) is better than theirs. * Never again run for president and tell voters that you want to raise taxes.  Even if it's only on high earners.  High earners have kids, parents, siblings, friends, and neighbors who all vote also.  If a reporter ever asks a future dem candidate about their position on taxes, the answer should be ""we feel strongly that we need to get the nose of the national debt pointed back into a safer trajectory. We have a list of investments in infrastructure that need to be addressed, but nothing - no bridges, no roads, no dams, no power lines - is going to be replaced if republicans keep eroding the tax base and driving us ever deeper in debt. We're on a bad trajectory, and both sides got us there."" * Don't ever - ever, ever, ever, ever - ignore inflation again.

You think you are big tough strong masculine bullies, but you are literally simping over an old man. You couldn't ride a dick any harder if you tried. Secondly a majority vote doesn't mean someone is more right than the other, all it means is you idiots are louder, and reproduce more. I hope you comment on my post, because I love your hatred, I'm going to bathe myself in it, and not even give you the satisfaction of responding to it, because I am already the bigger person by deciding not to, not that I would waste my breath or brain cells going in circles with you morons playing the ""I know you are but what am I?"" thing you filthy commies have been doing justifying your hatred by misdirecting to economics, and yes, hes taking advantage of all you poor, uneducated, prejudiced, misinformed, lazy, entitled, desperate, ""alphas"". You poor things. Ya know, the truth may not be as loud, it may get silenced, or get lost in the sauce, but its always out there. You can only cover your tracks so much before things just start coming up. The rich aren't here to save us. Never have been never will be. A job isn't a job anymore when the boss is your government. One person loses their freedoms the rest follows. History has told us this time and time again. Cutting off trade with tariffs and reinforcing immigration will not help a country that depends on trade for survival, but it will cut us off and distance us from the world more. A liberal media purge which you all assume is fake news, or biased against your beliefs, whatever, means you get one sided, biased, misinformation 24/7. There are no checks and balances on media coverage, meaning we get a constant flood of Trumps message. What he wants us to believe. Hes already done it, who are we even kidding, most of you are so delusional and detatched from reality, this is a waste of time even explaining it, while you think that is the ""right thing for America, make America Great again"" there was never anything wrong with America before Trump. People may have had different views but division and conflict hadn't occurred on this level over American politics GLOBALLY until he was a candidate. People played dirty but they didn't play this dirty. Things that have happened over his candidacy, if you would have asked me a decade ago if anything like what hes done or said sounds like an American President, I would say no. Anyone who is old enough, sane enough, smart enough would agree. Like dude Bush was cooler than this. Republicans were different then, had more integrity. Now, as for him helping the economy, bandaid solutions to gaping wound problems. To fix the economy you have to have people who are clean off drugs, people who are EDUCATED, people who are secure, have homes, access to information and resources, this creates job growth, personal growth, and ensures the happiness and growth of your citizens. Businesses with government regulation, have limits on what they can charge, because businesses unregulated can charge whatever, claim whatever, and get off scot free with minimal consequence. What's that mean? Say you order a defibrillator for emergencies and you have a heart condition and it doesn't work, the company that sold it to you isn't liable for faulty products. Pay up. Does anyone remember company stores? Coal camps? Where businesses owned the town, made the cost of living, made the cost of goods? Miserable. Pay up. Our abundance of year round produce like bananas, pineapples, ect. ect. Tariffs. Trade bans. I know you hate admitting you are wrong, I know it goes against your ""God"" or how you were ""raised"" but take away your religion, take away your political views, you are just hateful, ignorant, narcissistic, detatched, facetious, insecure, delusional, sad and angry little person. Maybe not all of those things, but many combinations of the list, yes. You chose to forsake others for money you won't get to touch, promises that won't be kept, and it will catch up with you. You've chosen ignorance when the Earth is at a pivotal point of deciding to open the mind or stay in the past thinking the past is a path for the future. Thats absolutely insane. And this is just for you Reddit Conservative Republican Christians who keep coming over here with your stupid show your small dick mentality. Now as for the rest of your votes that win you the election? Fake fascist commie Fox news. Voter fraud. We demand a recount. We won the election before it happened. Russia interfered in the election. He cheated. Hes senile. Hes a risk to national security. Tired Trump. He flooded the media both Conservative and Liberal for 12 years I call fraud on account of Stockholm Syndrome and misinformation based fraud combined with the effects of repetition frequency on the illusory truth effect. Hes already held you captive for 12 years. People just want you poor saps to wake up before you drink the freaking Kool-aid because they care about you.

Some even had started saying that Harris was ahead in some key swing states. As in 2016, the polls were at best, inaccurate. This time they weren't even close. They were all so smug about the polls and their findings. Then when trump won, the media turned.  They immediately proclaimed that they were sure all along that Harris would lose. They blamed everyone, including the voters. That's what pissed me off the most. They had the balls to blame those that voted! Talk about total gaslighting. Meanwhile, the right wing media gloats, mocks the liberals, and talks about liberal tears.  They're smug, and they're all assholes.   Eventually, I will go back to watching the news.

1gnrlns;Liberal;I keep hearing theories about how 15m people staying home didn't actually stay home and I'm not buying it.;I'm hearing now that it wasn't the fault of the 15m people who stayed home that Trump won.  I'm not buying it. As I look at Trump numbers, again, I see 74 million votes. That's what he had last time back in 2020. His base has not changed. Going on Joe Rogan didn't change, which, by the way, just want to say I called out Joe Rogan for being a conservative shill a long time ago.   But I digress. Where are these extra votes going to come from? Harris still sits firmly 4 million votes behind Trump. Eat me. No way she catches up. Those 15 million other votes just stayed home.   And I agree with the fact that they stayed home because she was a woman. Had she been a man she'd have won this election.  Misogyny is ingrained in America. THAT is why she lost. It's not because she wasn't qualified or what have you. It's because she's a woman.  She was younger, smarter, quicker, and agile... yet she lost to a senile old man who takes a crap anytime someone says something bad about him.  You will never convince me it WASN'T because she was a woman.  I say that as a white, atheist, bi man living in Idaho by the way. So if you want to question my motives for saying this. Go for it.  Edit: I see there are comments here pointing out the racism and yes, I agree, America is racist as shit. But Obama got elected. He was a man. Harris got more votes than Clinton but still couldn't clinch it. This tells me that America is more misogynistic than it is racist. But it is absolutely racist. I'm not disputing that.;hear theory m people stay home actually stay home buy hear fault m people stay home trump win buy look trump number million vote time base change go joe rogan change way want call joe rogan conservative shill long time ago digress extra vote go come harris sit firmly million vote trump eat way catch million vote stay home agree fact stay home woman man win election misogyny ingrain america lose qualified woman young smart quick agile lose senile old man take crap anytime say bad convince woman white atheist bi man live idaho way want question motive say edit comment point racism yes agree america racist shit obama get elect man harris get vote clinton clinch tell america misogynistic racist absolutely racist dispute;ComfortableWage;336;0.79;367;2024-11-10 03:31:48;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

1gnk7ug;Liberal;Liberals need to stop blaming themselves, and stop blaming Trump voters;"There's only one culprit behind why this season turned out the way it did, and it is misinformation. A concentrated, well-funded, scorched-earth campaign of lies that has been carried out from the ground up by Republican leadership.  It starts with Fox News, built up over decades to be a machine that spews out hate-filled lies 24/7 into the ears of the public. It continues with the media ecosystem of small publications, podcasters, and media personalities that echo the Fox News talking points and take it even further, waging the front lines of the culture war out of personal passion, not realizing--or not caring--they're the acting as the gullible patsies of the oligarchs who fund it all. And it is capped, in these years, by Trump himself, the most shameless liar to ever sully the stage of American politics with his presence. Trump, who cannot open his mouth without lying, who has managed to break every record for the number of lies spoken in a single speech, who built his popularity on the back of one Big Lie after another--without hesitating either to intersperse them with a thousand small lies.  It is tempting of course to look at our own leaders and our own policies and try to ask, ""what did we do wrong? What policy could we present differently to appeal to (*insert demographic here*)?"" But this is misguided, because how would any policy hold any appeal if they never know what it is?  It's tempting to look at the facts and the way our leaders spoke about them and say, ""She should have hit this fact harder, driven home this point more clearly!"" But what purpose does that ever serve if they don't know what the facts are?  Similarly, it is tempting to take refuge in the misery-laden moan of, ""Oh, this country is more racists/bigoted/misogynist than I thought it was!"" Certainly Trump actively courts the racist and misogynist vote, but if that were the beginning and end of the story then why did so many minorities and women vote for him? When you ask the rank-and-file voters--not the hardcore bigots--why they voted the way they did, it has to do with economy, policy, the border, and their own wellfare... all hard-and-fast, real-world factors.  Factors they are wrong about. Because of a deliberate campaign of lies.  We'll never be able to move toward a sane government as long as lies reign unchecked across our society. How can you make good decisions if you don't know the truth? And Trump supporters don't need to be unusually ignorant or naive to believe the lies when they're coming from every direction. When you hear the same thing on your preferred big cable TV news program, and from your favorite podcaster, and from your candidate for President (all people who you *should* be able to trust!) you'd have to be crazy to question it!  My theory is a cabal of wealthy oligarchs funded and built this media environment in order to promote policies good for themselves--low taxes on the rich and low regulation on business. In so doing, they have betrayed the trust of the millions of people who look to media for trustworthy information.  And we are never going to move forward as a country (liberal or otherwise!) unless we can undermine this campaign of lies and somehow move back to a shared sense of facts--and ones that are actually based in fact!  So stop blaming bigotry or Harris or Trump voters. Blame the oligarchs who've built this engine of lies for their own benefit.  And ask the real question, the only one likely to help: what do we do about it?";liberal need stop blame stop blame trump voter culprit season turn way misinformation concentrated fund scorch earth campaign lie carry ground republican leadership start fox news build decade machine spew hate fill lie ear public continue medium ecosystem small publication podcaster media personality echo fox news talking point wage line culture war personal passion realize care acting gullible patsy oligarch fund cap year trump shameless liar sully stage american politic presence trump open mouth lie manage break record number lie speak single speech build popularity big lie hesitate intersperse thousand small lie tempting course look leader policy try ask wrong policy present differently appeal insert demographic misguided policy hold appeal know tempting look fact way leader speak hit fact hard drive home point clearly purpose serve know fact similarly tempting refuge misery laden moan oh country racist bigote misogynist think certainly trump actively court racist misogynist vote beginning end story minority woman vote ask rank file voter hardcore bigot vote way economy policy border wellfare hard fast real world factor factor wrong deliberate campaign lie able sane government long lie reign unchecked society good decision know truth trump supporter need unusually ignorant naive believe lie come direction hear thing preferred big cable tv news program favorite podcaster candidate president people able trust crazy question theory cabal wealthy oligarch fund build medium environment order promote policy good low taxis rich low regulation business betray trust million people look medium trustworthy information go forward country liberal undermine campaign lie shared sense fact one actually base fact stop blame bigotry harris trump voter blame oligarch build engine lie benefit ask real question likely help;the_mist_maker;155;0.79;119;2024-11-09 21:17:51;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0
1gnivma;Liberal;How to fight and actually win ;First ask yourself, “what is a fucking liberal?”   If you let them define it, then you’re going to lose immediately. Words must mean something and theirs mean nothing.   A liberal is someone who wants change against what has been. Yes, there are other definitions, but we are gonna be merriam-Webster about this.   Now the idea that republicans can’t be liberal, isn’t true. Lincoln was a liberal republican. That’s important as the demonization of republicans will most certainly lead into not prying away their base. And prying away is just as important as creating a new movement and trying to get people to follow.   But we don’t need to create a new movement. There already exist one that is quite liberal. We borrow it. But we don’t return it.   ——  The current state of the world is that the very wealthy literally own everything. Even Republicans acknowledge this but they can’t put their finger on it (talking about voters not the elites who I’m speaking of anyways). Doesn’t matter what country you go to either. Left or right, they own it.   Even progressive voices acknowledge this. But they  put their focus on more than one topic and then the message becomes lost.   —— Why is that important?   Republicans tend to be single issue voters. Dems tend to focus on multiple things but then will hardline towards single issues at the end. So the single issue that has overlap is ….classism.   And the solution to classism most certainly covers almost all topics and demographics. They have, you don’t.   ——  The pivot must stress classism. You don’t always have to detail it so eloquently as if you were a philosopher being quoted some hundreds of years from now. I wouldn’t do that, as you’ll lose focus of the uneducated.   Conservative absolutely protect that classist ideology. But don’t attack conservatives themselves, just the belief in “their billionaires.”   ——  Next, we must sooner rather than later, pick someone to lead this. The way we do that is by highlighting them and sharing them everywhere (obviously). We all must brainstorm who that is. But it cannot be Sanders because of age. Ideally, it’s someone middle aged. That gets young and old on board. 60 is not middle aged. Somewhere around 40 is.   This person must not be elite or come from elites. It must be grassroots. You cannot have them accept from the rich. They must abstain. They essentially cannot be worth millions.   ——   If you did not read and only scrolled towards the end, the problem is that liberals (who want to change things) aren’t focusing on the main issue of the fact that the elites of owned things since our country’s birth. That needs to change and we must pivot to stress it.   Progressives need to understand that a lot of the issues involving civil liberties can change due to solving this issue, and conservatives don’t actually make up much of the country. The parties do. Most people believe in change.   Economic issues play one of the largest if not the largest, historically and most likely always will.   ——  Edit: but also brainstorm. Don’t just take it from me.

1gmpeef;Liberal;Temporary abortion compromise, followed immediately by massive electoral reform;I suggest we should look at this election loss from a perspective of vote-splitting. It's not the only valid perspective, but there are lessons here.  We can approximate the country into four quadrants divided along two axes: pro-life/pro-choice, pro-democracy/anti-democracy. The pro-choice/pro-democracy party is the institutional Democratic Party. The pro-life/pro-democracy people explicitly aren't allowed in that club, because the Party refuses to (as they would put it) compromise on women's rights, and the pro-life crowd won't compromise on the issue either. The anti-democracy people are the institutional Republican Party, and were able to work together better regardless of their pro-life/pro-choice stance. So now we have effectively three parties, in a system built for two, and vote-splitting screws the entire pro-democracy camp.  The correct solution is for the Democratic Party to compromise on the pro-life/pro-choice axis, on an *explicitly temporary* basis. Allow pro-life candidates back into the party, on the condition that once the Democratic Party gains power in any state or at a federal level, it should immediately begin a defined program of massive systematic reform, which includes reforms that make the system function with more than two parties. (No more first-past-the-post, approval voting FTW, among other solutions.) After that, the pro-life and pro-choice wings can safely part ways, but still opportunistically cooperate, without handing the entire government over to the fascists.  The GOP became the party of Trump due to vote-splitting, he won the 2016 primary with only 40% of the votes cast. The GOP didn't fix the problem, they doubled down. Can the Democrats instead learn the lesson that the fundamental problem is our election systems, and until that gets fixed, nothing else will?;temporary abortion compromise follow immediately massive electoral reform suggest look election loss perspective vote splitting valid perspective lesson approximate country quadrant divide axis pro life pro choice pro democracy anti democracy pro choice pro democracy party institutional democratic party pro life pro democracy people explicitly allow club party refuse compromise woman right pro life crowd will compromise issue anti democracy people institutional republican party able work well regardless pro life pro choice stance effectively party system build vote splitting screw entire pro democracy camp correct solution democratic party compromise pro life pro choice axis explicitly temporary basis allow pro life candidate party condition democratic party gain power state federal level immediately begin define program massive systematic reform include reform system function party past post approval vote ftw solution pro life pro choice wing safely way opportunistically cooperate hand entire government fascist gop party trump vote splitting win primary vote cast gop fix problem double democrats instead learn lesson fundamental problem election system get fix;swcollings;0;0.42;6;2024-11-08 18:27:08;:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:;0

If you want to be sad or defeatist its ok, but please go elsewhere with ""time to watch the world burn"" ""its too late we let this happen"" comments because I'm sure plenty of people want to keep going.  Obviously things don't look good - both in the US and with the far right gaining some ground in Europe.  But I don't want to give up. Unexpected things happen that change situations, dangerous people can still make mistakes, plenty of good people exist who will do the right thing, sometimes even people you won't expect do the right thing briefly (like Mike Pence). Liberals have an advantage in that we tend to be smarter and more accepting of facts (although we're not perfect by any means).

A great one I've seen is people boycotting republican supporting companies.  This next one is just an example and is probably really stupid, so please provide some better ideas.   Obviously more sensible nations might have concerns about a second Trump presidency and might be keen to get immigrants from America. Organisations can be formed to help people emigrate - heck being trapped in an unstable country is a crisis worthy of the formation of a charitable organisation at this point. People can drive investment in more sensible nations so they stand a better chance of competing economically/technologically with a potentially unstable US in the future.   Social media is obviously playing a role in misinforming people - left wing creators could figure out how to counter this.    Anyway, what are people's thoughts?

1gmc8es;Liberal;How do I provide support and reassurance to my peers while maintaining my stance of realism?;I (22M) am rather blunt on my instagram account, and I have to resolve some complaints and decisive questions for me from me peers (friends, high school alumni, fellow scene musicians).  My statement can be summarized as follows:   I am a Taiwanese-American dual citizen who could not care less about which western politician digs their own country's grave, I only take interest when Taiwan and South Korea are at risk of being buried in said grave. I did not vote for Trump, and I did not vote for Harris, therefore I did not vote against LGBTQ and women's interests nor did I vote against gun owners', and constitutionalist's interests. (I will not tell anyone if I voted third party or if I just left the presidential candidate slot blank). The only thing left to do is work with what we got, that if we intelligently advocate and carefully act, we can still convince the administration to change some of their decisions for the better.  And after the predicted response stating that Trump's administration is intent on implementing fascist policy, I ask the question: if there is an actual imminent threat of fascism, are you going to become the modern day French Resistance? Will you take up arms or at least support the insurgency's war effort?  I asked that question on my instagram story, I put it as a caption overlaid on the [French Resistance drive by scene](https://youtu.be/iMrk0twBLd8?si=lbQSz2cuESkbRb58&t=55) from the Great Escape movie, and on the next slides included [Squad gameplay](https://youtu.be/npNMxeRCZ74?si=Zy_B07Rhrs5_RF5V&t=92) and [Ukrainian infantry machine gunner footage](https://youtu.be/wVYXa3zN2As?si=sFK5uExQm67Jykvx&t=325) to emphasize what real world warfare could be like.  People are traumatized, and I want to reassure them that there is hope in saving the US from tyranny, but I also have to be realistic and showcase a possible worst case scenario and what it would take to defeat martial law imposed by the administration.  How should I best approach this situation? I may be a relatively westernized ABC, but I still have a different mindset than most Americans.

1gm64q1;Liberal;What separates totalitarian nationalism from fascism.;I'm going to do my best to talk about something that needs to be talked about without breaking the rules. If I fail at that hopefully enough people will see it before this gets deleted.   I see a lot of talk about fascism and project 2025 throughout our left-leaning public spheres. However, what I don't see is anyone talking about the fact that fascism, by definition, is distinguished from other forms of totalitarian governments by its glorification and use of political violence.  If you truly think that we are witnessing the emergence of American facism, you see political violence as not merely a possiblity but a certainty. I'm not attempting to make a claim here for or against fascism being on the horizon, just that is what saying that it is would imply.  I hope that helps highlight one key thing that conservatives have absolutely been screaming from the rooftops for as long as I can remember and that they absolutely nailed on the head. The 2nd amendment is critical to the survival of democracy. If you wait until there is no question that we live under a fascist regime to prepare you will be SOL.   This is not a call to violence! This is simply highlighting the FACT that our constitution has provisions to prevent our country from ever regressing to totalitarian governing, of which fascism is the most insidious. I hope this doesn't get censored and I hope this can shift some minds to understanding why conservatives have for so long refused to sacrifice any ground when it comes to gun rights. Those rights belong to you too and I hope you don't squander them thinking it'll never be necessary.;separate totalitarian nationalism fascism go good talk need talk break rule fail hopefully people get delete lot talk fascism project left lean public sphere talk fact fascism definition distinguish form totalitarian government glorification use political violence truly think witness emergence american facism political violence merely possiblity certainty attempt claim fascism horizon say imply hope help highlight key thing conservative absolutely scream rooftop long remember absolutely nail head amendment critical survival democracy wait question live fascist regime prepare sol violence simply highlight fact constitution provision prevent country regress totalitarian governing fascism insidious hope censor hope shift mind understand conservative long refuse sacrifice ground come gun right right belong hope squander think necessary;Jet_Maal;7;0.71;15;2024-11-08 00:49:11;NA;0

1jryz2s;PoliticalDiscussion;Do progressives see the trade-offs between taxing corporations, shrinking billionaire wealth, and the impact on regular people?;Not trying to be controversial —this is something I’ve genuinely been thinking about.  A lot of progressive arguments I see are centered around billionaires being too rich, corporations not paying enough, etc. Fair enough. But now, with things like tariffs and market instability, we’re seeing companies take a hit and billionaire wealth shrink—and people seem upset.  It feels like there’s a tension between wanting systemic change and not wanting personal discomfort. Like, we want corporations to “pay their fair share,” but we still want cheap iPhones. Or we want billionaires to lose wealth, but don’t want our 401(k)s to drop.  I’m curious how people on the left think about this. Is it just that these aren’t the right tools? Or is there a way these goals are reconciled that I’m not seeing? ;progressive trade off tax corporation shrink billionaire wealth impact regular people try controversial genuinely think lot progressive argument center billionaire rich corporation pay etc fair thing like tariff market instability see company hit billionaire wealth shrink people upset feel like tension want systemic change want personal discomfort like want corporation pay fair share want cheap iphone want billionaire lose wealth want drop curious people left think right tool way goal reconcile see;Mental_Bicep;0;0.15;23;2025-04-05 08:37:17;US Politics;0
1jrzlk2;PoliticalDiscussion;Should Election day be a national Holiday?;From my own casual understandings of US politics (I'm no professional to be clear) one of the most common ways in the US to discourage turnout for the other party is to make it as difficult as possible to vote on Election day. So would it help democracy if election day was a day off from work in the same vein as labor day? Would it not make it harder to suppress the vote then? (It's not a perfect solution but it's a little bit to help);election day national holiday casual understanding politic professional clear common way discourage turnout party difficult possible vote election day help democracy election day day work vein labor day hard suppress vote perfect solution little bit help;Miniclift239;132;0.95;87;2025-04-05 09:25:08;US Elections;0
1jr5ema;PoliticalDiscussion;What if U.S. House districts had UK-style constituency names based on local geography?;In the UK, parliamentary constituencies are given unique names based on the areas they cover - whether that’s a part of a city (e.g. *Leeds North West*) or a broader geographic location (e.g. *Calder Valley*). As someone with a keen interest in American politics, I was wondering: if U.S. House districts followed a similar naming pattern, would these kinds of names feel appropriate?  For transparency, I used the deep research feature on ChatGPT to compile this list, but I thought it might spark some good discussion. I’d love to hear your thoughts - especially if you live in the district!  **Alabama**   **AL-1**: Mobile   **AL-2**: Montgomery   **AL-3**: Auburn   **AL-4**: Muscle Shoals   **AL-5**: Huntsville

1jru0s9;PoliticalDiscussion;Any chance of states seceding(?);Food for thought, but was thinking about states responses to the tariff situation and one state that sticks out by far is Hawaii. Some sticking points are: $2.5 BN imports to $700MM exports, import 85-90% of food (yes a lot is from mainland US however), and top countries of imports are all getting hit hardest with Tariffs (China, Japan, SE Asia, Canada etc.).   Hawaii has always been culturally distant from the US and have a decent push to separate from the US. Visited a few years ago and all we heard from locals that they couldn’t care less about US politics. I really have to think that upending there entire economy through tariffs while they couldn’t associate as “American” less, could quickly push them towards formally seceding.

1jrwfea;PoliticalDiscussion;Do you think that there should be more or less disagreement within the Republican and Democratic parties?;"Let me explain what I mean...  It seems like the the American two party system has evolved into such a way where each side has picked what side of an issue they fall onto and they demand almost undying loyalty of their members to everything in the platform. I think a great example of this is how the two main US political parties treat those within their own party who buck party lines regarding gun control. Of the just over 400 members of the House of Representatives that voted on an assault weapons ban in 2022, only 7 of those who voted bucked party lines, 5 Democrats and 2 Republicans to be specific. Chris Jacobs, one of the Republicans who voted in favor of the assault weapons ban, felt compelled to not seek reelection after facing backlash for voting in favor of gun control.  [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/30/congress-members-broke-party-assault-weapons-ban/10191151002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/07/30/congress-members-broke-party-assault-weapons-ban/10191151002/)  I understand that when it comes to being on a federal level legislature, too many dissenting voices can cause unnecessary gridlock for key legislation.  \*\*However, I feel like politics these days has given us the choice between two different sandwiches with some unsavory ingredients, and we are rarely given the option of removing or switching ingredients within the sandwich, we have to take the sandwich as is. Maybe South Park was right about our only viable political options being a giant douche and a turd sandwich. It's like the two political parties know this and have convinced a lot of people that ""The worst person in our political party is better than the best person in the other political party.""\*\*  # So should there be more people and politicians willing to publicly disagree with their preferred political party on controversial issues?";think disagreement republican democratic party let explain mean like american party system evolve way pick issue fall demand undying loyalty member platform think great example main political party treat party buck party line gun control member house representatives vote assault weapon ban vote buck party line democrats republicans specific chris jacobs republicans vote favor assault weapon ban feel compel seek reelection face backlash vote favor gun control understand come federal level legislature dissent voice cause unnecessary gridlock key legislation feel like politic day give choice different sandwich unsavory ingredient rarely give option remove switch ingredient sandwich sandwich maybe south park right viable political option giant douche turd sandwich like political party know convince lot people bad person political party well good person political party people politician willing publicly disagree preferred political party controversial issue;semiwadcutter38;0;0.47;30;2025-04-05 05:37:02;US Politics;0

1jrqjkm;PoliticalDiscussion;"What is the criteria of ""good or bad"" in the Tariff Debate?";"Discussions about Trump's tariffs often overlook a critical prerequisite for meaningful dialogue: *defining success*. Participants rush to argue whether tariffs are ""good"" or ""bad"" without first establishing what those terms mean.  To evaluate tariffs effectively, we must:  1. **Set a Clear Target**: Identify what ""good"" means in this context. Is it job creation? Trade deficit reduction? Consumer price stability? 2. **Adopt an Objective Metric**  Since we're discussing whether Trump's tariffs are good or bad, we first need to define what constitutes ""good."" The most objective single criterion for measuring tariff success would logically be **net economic welfare impact**.  However, this definition invites criticism. Tariffs act as a regressive tax, disproportionately burdening lower-income households. Imagine a hypothetical scenario where the top 1% grows significantly richer while 5% of Americans fall into severe deprivation—even starvation—despite an overall rise in national wealth. Would we still consider this a ""success""?  Many other unforeseen factors could emerge in this debate—issues that may not be immediately obvious but become glaring once pointed out.

1jrh1b7;PoliticalDiscussion;With the US stock market entering bear market territory in reaction to Trump's tariffs, will this cause Americans to sour on MAGA?;Obviously the stock market is not the economy and it does not measure economic performance in real time despite what people think. Many retired Americans rely on stock market returns in their 401ks and IRA's to be able to live and enjoy their lives. Many of these older Americans also voted for Trump under the premise that he would make them better off financially.  Will Trump's recent escalation in tariffs and the reaction of the markets cause his supporters to erode? A big reason that he won the election was that voters were frustrated with the Democratic Party's handling of the economy.  Unlike most market drops, this one is quite easy to pinpoint the reason for the drop and many of his voters will have a very glaring reason to why their portfolios lost so much money so quickly. Will they connect the dots and point this to Trump or will they blame something else?;stock market enter bear market territory reaction trump tariff cause americans sour maga obviously stock market economy measure economic performance real time despite people think retired americans rely stock market return ira able live enjoy life old americans vote trump premise well financially trump recent escalation tariff reaction market cause supporter erode big reason win election voter frustrate democratic party handling economy unlike market drop easy pinpoint reason drop voter glaring reason portfolio lose money quickly connect dot point trump blame;Tronn3000;209;0.93;210;2025-04-04 17:06:47;US Politics;0

1jqlm0l;PoliticalDiscussion;Given dismal special election results this week and a looming recession, will Congressional Republicans start to push back against Trump in fear of being defeated in 2026? Or will they continue to support him?;As the old adage goes, the number one priority for a politician is getting re-elected. Currently, there are 3 Senate Republicans up for reelection in swing states: these are Maine, North Carolina and Ohio. In the House, 2 Republicans (Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Gabe Evans) won by less than 1%. Another 4 Republicans won by less than 2%. Another 9 Republicans won by less than 5%.  The special election in Florida last week saw Republican Randy Fine win a deep-red district by tighter margins than previous elections. In 2022, Mike Waltz had won by 66%-33%. Last week, Fine won by 56%-42%.  Most economists predict that the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration will cause an increase in prices across the board including for gas, groceries and other household essentials. Furthermore, a growing number of economists are predicting an outright recession sometime within the next two years as a direct result of Trump's economic policy.  Given these factors, will we see vulnerable Republicans start to turn against Trump and vote against his agenda - if for no other reason, then even simply a fear of losing reelection in a blue wave? Or is their loyalty to Trump so strong that they will support his agenda even if it means being defeated in 2026?;give dismal special election result week loom recession congressional republicans start push trump fear defeat continue support old adage go number priority politician get elect currently senate republicans reelection swing state maine north carolina ohio house republicans mariannette miller meeks gabe evans win republicans win republicans win special election florida week see republican randy fine win deep red district tight margin previous election mike waltz win week fine win economist predict tariff implement trump administration cause increase price board include gas grocery household essential furthermore grow number economist predict outright recession year direct result trump economic policy give factor vulnerable republicans start turn trump vote agenda reason simply fear lose reelection blue wave loyalty trump strong support agenda mean defeat;premeddit;342;0.96;221;2025-04-03 15:35:15;US Elections;0

1jq0w1k;PoliticalDiscussion;Who is benefiting from these tariffs?;From my basic understanding of what is happening here, the intention of tariffs is that companies will move to manufacturing items here in the US rather than buy overseas.  Does that, say, 25% tariff that's being added to the sale go to the US government?  If the money goes to the government, isn't that just a tax?  Does it mean that the government can do whatever they want with that money since it's not our tax dollars being allocated by Congress?   Who benefits from these tariffs since it will take years for US companies to set up these manufacturing facilities, and they're likely going to being using machines and AI instead of hiring production employees.  If we become isolationists with these tariffs and these products are obviously already being produced somewhere else for cheaper, we'll have a significantly smaller market to sell these products to, basically just within the US. My feeling on this is that it will be impossible to make all products 100% here in the US.  Manufacturers will still order parts from other countries with a 25% tariff (or whatever it is), then the pieces that are made here will be more expensive because of the workforce and wages, so we will inevitably be paying more for products no matter which way you spin it.  So, who exactly wants these tariffs?  There has to be a a group of people somewhere that will benefit because it's not being stopped.;benefit tariff basic understanding happen intention tariff company manufacturing item buy overseas tariff add sale government money go government tax mean government want money tax dollar allocate congress benefit tariff year company set manufacturing facility likely go machine ai instead hire production employee isolationist tariff product obviously produce cheap significantly small market sell product basically feeling impossible product manufacturer order part country tariff piece expensive workforce wage inevitably pay product matter way spin exactly want tariff group people benefit stop;ButtScratchies;621;0.97;597;2025-04-02 21:48:50;Political Theory;0

1jpfq6y;PoliticalDiscussion;Do these election results represent a shift or follow a historical trend?;Being a Wisconsin resident, I have been grateful to live in a state that gets a ton of attention come election seasons! Obviously today, Wisconsin was one of two states to have elections, however I thought this election specifically was unique especially with the last minute push by Musk and Trump for Brad Schimel adding an extra level of attention. Obviously it fell short, with Susan Crawford leading by about 10 points as of reading this. However, this trend seemed to continue in Florida somewhat too.   For example, according to @VoteHubUS on X,  all four counties shifted left by a sizeable margin even from just a few months ago in November.   My question is do you think this should be an early warning sign for Republicans about midterms, or would these results be more attributable to the general trend of Democrats having better turnout in special elections than Republicans?

1jpf33s;PoliticalDiscussion;Do symbolic actions by politicians help create real change?;Do symbolic actions by politicians (like record-breaking speeches) help create real change, or do they shift responsibility away from those in power? How can we hold elected officials accountable for meaningful action rather than just rhetoric?  While some celebrate Cory Booker’s record-breaking speech, I think it reminds me of a broader issue in politics: the tendency for performative activism to be celebrated as if it’s meaningful change. Symbolic gestures like this make sense for community activists without legislative power, but when elected officials engage in it without backing it up with real policy moves, it feels like an easy way to appear engaged without taking the risks or doing the work needed for actual change. Instead of taking direct action, this kind of display shifts responsibility onto others while allowing politicians to claim they’ve ‘done something'. Elected officials should be held to a higher standard.  That said, symbolic actions and speeches like this could be useful if it builds momentum for substantive action, but only if it's followed by actual strategy, policy changes, and concrete actions. So I guess maybe I am just hesitant to praise the performance yet because the real question is whether it will be part of a broader effort to take action, enact real change, or if it is just an empty gesture that distracts from real progress. Without translating into concrete action, it just feels hollow, especially coming from someone in a position of power.;symbolic action politician help create real change symbolic action politician like record break speech help create real change shift responsibility away power hold elect official accountable meaningful action rhetoric celebrate cory booker record break speech think remind broad issue politic tendency performative activism celebrate meaningful change symbolic gesture like sense community activist legislative power elect official engage back real policy move feel like easy way appear engage take risk work need actual change instead take direct action kind display shift responsibility allow politician claim elect official hold high standard say symbolic action speech like useful build momentum substantive action follow actual strategy policy change concrete action guess maybe hesitant praise performance real question broad effort action enact real change gesture distract real progress translate concrete action feel hollow especially come position power;Future-Outcome-5226;23;0.81;56;2025-04-02 03:18:54;US Politics;0

1jo8z20;PoliticalDiscussion;American Citizens being wrongfully targetted by ICE actions?;It's very clear that Trump's current deportation actions are becoming more sweeping, moving beyond illegal migrants to those with temporary protected status, student and academic visas, and legal immigrants. We also know that historically, when Eisenhower conducted sweeping deportations, American citizens of Mexican descent were wrongfully deported. It feels like this is going to happen again at some scale, but I am not American or in the US - I potentially do not have a full picture.  There have been a few reports of citizens being caught up in ICE raids, but I am curious about the scale of this issue.  I can find some reports of Native Americans being questioned during ICE raids although I can find few specifics.   There is also a report on a raid of a seafood processing plant, in which they targetted Hispanic workers specifically and detained US citizens. I assume those citizens were then released, and the case sparked outrage (as it should). https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/immigration-raid-newark-new-jersey-mayor-angry-rcna189100  When actions are so rapid and sweeping, it seems like citizens will inevitably get caught up in them.

1jnuxws;PoliticalDiscussion;Should we be seriously concerned that Trump is mentally unwell?;"I know this title is going to sound like a partisan attack to some. But, I'm wondering if we should be seriously considering the possibility that the US president is an older man who has experienced notable cognitive decline and is behaving erratically.   When Trump is discussed, you will occasionally here people using the term ""sanewashing"". This means acting like Trump's ideas are saner than they really are. His supporters want to believe he's playing 4-D chess. His opponents want to believe he has sinister intentions. But, could it be that his behavior legitimately does not make sense because he is unwell?   The man is currently threatening Canada, Greenland, and Panama. On the campaign trail, there was no mention of the idea that he might try to forcibly expand US territory. No one voted for that. I don't think his own party is on board with these ideas. These ideas seem legitimately crazy.   Not that long ago, he was calling Zelensky a dictator because there haven't been elections. Later, when questioned, he said ""Did I say that?"". Now, he is apparently angry at Putin for questioning Zelensky's legitimacy. Is he seriously confused?   Some people want to believe that Trump is attempting to implement madman theory. This was a political strategy popularized by Nixon who wanted US adversaries to believe that he was capable of anything. But...could it be that Trump is legitimately losing his mind?   There's an argument that the world has a problem with aging leaders. Famously, people began having doubts about Biden's cognitive ability. There also might be reason to question Putin's mental state. When asked to explain the war, he begins talking about medieval history. And now, the US is led by a man in his 70's whose behavior might be described as erratic.   I don't want to be agist, but it’s an established medical fact that older people experience brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. In the US, we've seen examples of older politicians (like Diane Feinstein) who noticeably decline while in office. There's a problem with people continuing to elect well known incumbents, not realizing that they are losing it as they get older.

1jmp1bl;PoliticalDiscussion;What will most likely be the next political order post-MAGA/Trump era?;"It seems this ""abundance agenda"" or ""supply side progressivism"" is the most debated way forward for not just Democrats but also for the next brand new political establishment post MAGA/Trump/Sanders era. It's basically an agenda that combines some of the important economic justice policies on labor bargaining & healthcare that progressives support with market based deregulatory pro-growth policies on housing, technology and green infrastructure that moderates support when it comes to cuttting government red tape. I am aware that many  believe that Harris already had some aspects of this sort of agenda like with her ""carrot & stick"" gov't housing grant policy during the 2024 campaign. However, a specific articulated vision wasn't really clarified. In fact, no one really had a buzzword to define this agenda and get people sold and excited on it. It's one thing to have sensible policies for a campaign, but it's another thing to actually sell it to the broader public. Before Klein, Thompson, and Yglesias ever delved into how our own liberal buracracy had been hampering America's progress ever since the 2nd half of the New Deal era & the Neoliberal era, there was never really school of thought around this sort of political order.  Now, I have actually completed Klein's new book, and it's clear that Thompsom and him have done their homework despite anyone's views on their political prescription for this turbulent time. How do you think Democrats as a whole can pitch this to the public and build a broad coalition that supports this from local, state, and federal levels? What candidate, come 2028, do you think will be able to unify the Democrats, and more importantly the broader electorate around this agenda?  From an intellectual standpoint, history has shown that during times of deep crisis, a sort of rebirth or new political order emerges. The excesses of Monopolistic Laissez-faire capitalism during the Gilded Age gave way to a nonmonopolistic yet still laissez-faire capitalism emerged during the Progressive era. The excesses of this then gave way to New Deal liberalism, and then the excesses of the New Deal gave way to Neoliberalism. Just in general, not just in American history, everything in world history tends to work in cycles. Periods of Peace,Prosperity, and Optimism under some new order devolved into periods of unrest, hardship, and increased corruption, giving way to the emergence of a new political order, and so the cycle repeats. Humanity's past is literred with nuances and duality in how our systems & cultures have evolved. No single political or cultural movement have ever dominated in the ashes of crisis eras but instead it's been mergers of multiple movements with one slightly coming on top. It's more complicated than any ideological purist might think.";likely political order post maga trump era abundance agenda supply progressivism debate way forward democrats brand new political establishment post maga trump sanders era basically agenda combine important economic justice policy labor bargaining healthcare progressive support market base deregulatory pro growth policy housing technology green infrastructure moderate support come cuttte government red tape aware believe harris aspect sort agenda like carrot stick housing grant policy campaign specific articulate vision clarify fact buzzword define agenda people sell excited thing sensible policy campaign thing actually sell broad public klein thompson yglesias delve liberal buracracy hamper america progress half new deal era neoliberal era school thought sort political order actually complete klein new book clear thompsom homework despite view political prescription turbulent time think democrats pitch public build broad coalition support local state federal level candidate come think able unify democrats importantly broad electorate agenda intellectual standpoint history show time deep crisis sort rebirth new political order emerge excess monopolistic laissez faire capitalism gilded age give way nonmonopolistic laissez faire capitalism emerge progressive era excess give way new deal liberalism excess new deal give way neoliberalism general american history world history tend work cycle periods peace prosperity optimism new order devolve period unrest hardship increase corruption give way emergence new political order cycle repeat humanity past literre nuance duality system culture evolve single political cultural movement dominate ashe crisis era instead merger multiple movement slightly come complicated ideological purist think;godlike_hikikomori;46;0.76;105;2025-03-29 15:40:37;Political History;0
1jms1oj;PoliticalDiscussion;Is Trump shrinking the size of the federal government or simply concentrating power in the White House?;President Donald Trump entered his new 2025 term vowing to shrink the federal government, slashing what he calls wasteful bureaucracy. In practice, his administration has enacted mass layoffs of federal employees, proposed closing or gutting entire agencies (and in some cases effectively already has), issued a flurry of executive orders to reshape policy, and even clashed with courts and watchdogs overseeing his actions.

1jkqbmk;PoliticalDiscussion;Chances of America Going to War Within the Next 5 Years?; With the U.S. having withdrawn from Afghanistan and largely shifted away from large-scale counterinsurgency operations, the military has been in a period of relative peace. However, history suggests that the U.S. rarely stays out of conflict for long. Now, in 2025, several geopolitical flashpoints could push America toward another war within the next five years.  One of the most immediate concerns is the situation in Yemen. Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have increasingly targeted international shipping in the Red Sea, prompting U.S. military retaliation. While the U.S. has thus far relied on air and naval strikes, there is always the possibility of escalation, especially if Houthi attacks continue or Iran becomes more directly involved. Could this lead to an eventual ground deployment?  Beyond Yemen, tensions with China remain a key concern, particularly regarding Taiwan. While a full-scale Chinese invasion seems unlikely in the immediate future, ongoing military provocations and economic warfare could lead to a crisis that forces the U.S. into action. Would this result in a direct military confrontation, or would the U.S. rely on deterrence and proxy strategies?  In Europe, Russia’s war in Ukraine continues, with speculation about Moscow’s willingness to expand its aggression beyond Ukraine’s borders. If NATO allies like the Baltic states or Poland are threatened, would the U.S. be compelled to send troops into combat under Article 5 of the NATO treaty?  Iran is another major factor. Beyond its involvement in Yemen, Iranian-backed militias across the Middle East—particularly in Iraq and Syria—have increased attacks on U.S. bases. Could a major provocation, such as a deadly attack on U.S. forces, lead to a direct American intervention?  Additionally, there are growing threats in Africa, where extremist groups are expanding in regions like the Sahel. If instability spreads and threatens U.S. interests or allies, would that be another potential theater for American ground forces?  Given these circumstances in 2025, what are the realistic chances of the U.S. deploying ground troops into a new war within the next five years? Which of these conflicts—Yemen, Taiwan, Ukraine, Iran, or Africa—is the most likely to escalate into a large-scale U.S. military engagement? Or will the U.S. continue to avoid direct combat while relying on airpower, naval forces, and proxy support?;chance america go war year have withdraw afghanistan largely shift away large scale counterinsurgency operation military period relative peace history suggest rarely stay conflict long geopolitical flashpoint push america war year immediate concern situation yemen houthi rebel back iran increasingly target international shipping red sea prompt military retaliation far rely air naval strike possibility escalation especially houthi attack continue iran directly involve lead eventual ground deployment yemen tension china remain key concern particularly taiwan scale chinese invasion unlikely immediate future ongoing military provocation economic warfare lead crisis force action result direct military confrontation rely deterrence proxy strategy europe russia war ukraine continue speculation moscow willingness expand aggression ukraine border nato ally like baltic state poland threaten compel send troop combat article nato treaty iran major factor involvement yemen iranian back militia middle east particularly iraq syria increase attack basis major provocation deadly attack force lead direct american intervention additionally grow threat africa extremist group expand region like sahel instability spread threaten interest ally potential theater american ground force give circumstance realistic chance deploy ground troop new war year conflict yemen taiwan ukraine iran africa likely escalate large scale military engagement continue avoid direct combat rely airpower naval force proxy support;Broad_Ad4229;162;0.83;385;2025-03-26 23:42:59;US Politics;0
1jku6mw;PoliticalDiscussion;What are your thoughts on the bombings discussed in the recent Yemen group chat leak?;As most people are aware, the Trump administration has recently been embarrassed after a mishap with the messaging app Signal. They were using the app to discuss a bombing in Yemen. However, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz accidentally added the editor in chief of the Atlantic to the conversation.   The Trump administration is currently in damage control. They are fending off attacks from the Democrats, while trying to minimize the significance of the mistake. One of their common refrains is that people should be focusing on the success of the mission. They say their critics are focusing on a small mistake, while ignoring the good work they're doing in Yemen.   Yemen often doesn't get much attention in the media. If not for this recent controversy, the bombings would likely not have been as widely reported. The Trump administration is arguing that we're not talking enough about the bombing at the heart of the story. Very well then, let's talk about Yemen.   **The Recent History of Yemen**  Yemen is an impoverished and war torn country. They've been in a long running civil war. For several years, Saudi Arabia was embroiled in this conflict after backing a particular side in the civil war. This was a brutal conflict that had catastrophic humanitarian consequences in Yemen. There was a significant amount of death, disease, and famine in the country.   During this conflict, the US provided military and logistical support to Saudi Arabia. Certain Yemeni fighters received support from Iran.   In 2022, there was a ceasefire between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This ceasefire was strongly supported and diplomatically pushed for by the Biden administration. As of now, the civil war is still unresolved, but has entered a low intensity phase.   After the recent Israel-Hamas conflict, Yemeni fighters began launching rockets at ships passing though the Red Sea. They have also launched rockets at Israel.   **What are your opinions on the recent US bombings?**  As shown in the recent Signal conversation, the Trump administration has taken a more adversarial stance towards Yemen, and they are bombing the country.   The conflicts in Yemen are messy and controversial. Is it good for the US to be bombing the country? Is it necessary for the security of the region? What are the humanitarian implications?   In the attack, the US destroyed an apartment building in order to kill a significant Yemeni rebel. There were a number of civilian casualties. Is this collateral damage acceptable?   What are your thoughts on Yemen? What should be the US approach to the country? What conclusions can we draw about how the Trump administration is likely to approach this region?;thought bombing discuss recent yemen group chat leak people aware trump administration recently embarrassed mishap message app signal app discuss bombing yemen national security advisor mike waltz accidentally add editor chief atlantic conversation trump administration currently damage control fend attack democrats try minimize significance mistake common refrain people focus success mission critic focus small mistake ignore good work yemen yemen attention medium recent controversy bombing likely widely report trump administration argue talk bombing heart story let talk yemen recent history yemen yemen impoverished war tear country long run civil war year saudi arabia embroil conflict back particular civil war brutal conflict catastrophic humanitarian consequence yemen significant death disease famine country conflict provide military logistical support saudi arabia certain yemeni fighter receive support iran ceasefire saudi arabia yemen ceasefire strongly support diplomatically push biden administration civil war unresolved enter low intensity phase recent israel hamas conflict yemeni fighter begin launch rocket ship pass red sea launch rocket israel opinion recent bombing show recent signal conversation trump administration take adversarial stance yemen bomb country conflict yemen messy controversial good bomb country necessary security region humanitarian implication attack destroy apartment building order kill significant yemeni rebel number civilian casualty collateral damage acceptable thought yemen approach country conclusion draw trump administration likely approach region;damndirtyape;134;0.87;323;2025-03-27 02:54:02;International Politics;0

However, these are the same concerns that were raised about Trump’s classified document case at Mar-A-Lago, which involved a much larger volume of sensitive materials.

1jiwxjy;PoliticalDiscussion;Jon Stewart criticized Senate Democrats’ cloture vote as political theater. Does the evidence support that view?;In March 2025, the Senate held a cloture vote on a Republican-led continuing resolution to avoid a government shutdown. Ten Democrats voted yes to move the bill forward. The remaining Democrats — including **every senator up for reelection in 2026** — voted no.  Jon Stewart recently criticized the vote on his podcast, calling it “a play” meant to protect vulnerable senators from political blowback while letting safe or retiring members carry the controversial vote.  The vote breakdown is striking:  * **Not one vulnerable Democrat voted yes** * **The group of “no” votes includes both liberals and moderates, in both safe and swing states**  This pattern raises questions about whether the vote reflected individual convictions — or a coordinated effort to manage political risk.  **Questions for discussion:**  * Do you agree with Stewart? What this just political theatre? * Will shielding vulnerable senators from a tough vote actually help them win re-election — or just delay the backlash? * Could this strategy backfire and make more Democrats — not just the 2026 class — targets for primary challenges? * Is using safe or retiring members to absorb political risk a uniquely Democratic tactic — or would Republicans do the same thing if the roles were reversed?  ;jon stewart criticize senate democrats cloture vote political theater evidence support view march senate hold cloture vote republican lead continue resolution avoid government shutdown democrats vote yes bill forward remain democrats include senator reelection vote jon stewart recently criticize vote podcast call play mean protect vulnerable senator political blowback let safe retire member carry controversial vote vote breakdown strike vulnerable democrat vote yes group vote include liberal moderate safe swing state pattern raise question vote reflect individual conviction coordinated effort manage political risk question discussion agree stewart political theatre shielding vulnerable senator tough vote actually help win election delay backlash strategy backfire democrats class target primary challenge safe retire member absorb political risk uniquely democratic tactic republicans thing role reverse;erg99;220;0.94;197;2025-03-24 17:50:05;US Politics;0
1jj8iq3;PoliticalDiscussion;What methods are there for media reform to improve the quality of news reporting, and raise awareness to more topical and relevant information to the public, without using censorships?;It seems that due to the internet landscape, people are often trapped in their own information bubbles isolating themselves from many other subsections of the country. This creates a dichotomy where many people are often informed within their niche information groups, but may be completely blindsided by information outside their own spaces. Leading to massive disconnect between what people know from one another. This is why someone who might seem well informed, may actually be missing important context that just wasn't presented to them.  And this is a problem not exclusive to any particular side of the political spectrum, its a problem that just about everyone has fallen into. Everyone has likely consumed a news story, that gives limited context and information of the given story, thus creating a misconstrued narrative of reality.  With that in mind, because censorship is impossible, both on a moral, practical, and legal level, what ways can media and social media reform be enacted, but in a way that doesn't include censorship requirements?;method medium reform improve quality news reporting raise awareness topical relevant information public censorship internet landscape people trap information bubble isolate subsection country create dichotomy people inform niche information group completely blindside information outside space lead massive disconnect people know inform actually miss important context present problem exclusive particular political spectrum problem fall likely consume news story give limited context information give story create misconstrue narrative reality mind censorship impossible moral practical legal level way medium social medium reform enact way include censorship requirement;illegalmorality;77;0.88;162;2025-03-25 01:57:38;Political Theory;0
1jiffpg;PoliticalDiscussion;Should supply side progressivism be a core part of the Democratic Party moving forward?;Supply side progressivism is a political view that focuses on agendas like economic growth, improving affordable, and increased opportunity by using progressive policies and supply side economics.  The largest difference from today’s primary progressive movement is that it is results and outcomes focused.  Instead of passing a policy and expecting it to work, it digs into the details of valuing a policy on how well it works.  It critiques the current Democratic Party for trying to regulate too much and add too many things which end up slowing down or even killing certain projects.  Key examples include a $1.7 million dollar toilet in San Francisco or the high speed rail in California which had been in development for decades with no end in sight.  Other examples include the hoops that the Biden administration has pushed semiconductor companies to get CHIPS funding like diversity quotas and childcare support.  Biden also promised bringing internet to rural communities, a project that has continued to struggle years after its inception.    This initiative is what a DOGE would actually be like.  Instead of through billions and billions blindly at a problem, politicians would improve both the efficiency and efficacy of their policies.  It focuses on expediting permits for clean energy instead of having them stuck in limbo.  Pushing for YIMBYism (yes in my backyard) and more housing.    Ezra Klein has been a big supporter of supply side progressivism and has recently come out with a new book called “abundance”.   In an era where trust in the government is at an all time low, could supply side progressivism help democrats regain the public’s trust and rebuild the institutions as something stronger?  ;supply progressivism core democratic party move forward supply progressivism political view focus agenda like economic growth improve affordable increase opportunity progressive policy supply economic large difference today primary progressive movement result outcome focus instead pass policy expect work dig detail value policy work critique current democratic party try regulate add thing end slow kill certain project key example include million dollar toilet san francisco high speed rail california development decade end sight example include hoop biden administration push semiconductor company chips fund like diversity quota childcare support biden promise bring internet rural community project continue struggle year inception initiative doge actually like instead billion billion blindly problem politician improve efficiency efficacy policy focus expedite permit clean energy instead have stick limbo push yimbyism yes backyard housing ezra klein big supporter supply progressivism recently come new book call abundance era trust government time low supply progressivism help democrats regain public trust rebuild institution strong;Visco0825;69;0.67;502;2025-03-24 01:30:09;US Politics;0

1jhga86;PoliticalDiscussion;What are the legal and political implications of deporting asylum seekers to CECOT despite a federal court order?;Over the weekend, the Trump administration deported approximately 250 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. At least one individual reportedly had a pending asylum hearing. The deportations occurred after a federal judge issued an order to halt them. According to administration officials, the order was not binding once planes had left U.S. airspace.  The deportees were sent to El Salvador’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT), a large-scale prison described by international human rights organizations as overcrowded, isolated, and operating without meaningful due process. Reports indicate that detainees are held in near-total lockdown, denied communication with lawyers or family, and not guaranteed individual trials.  This situation raises several legal and constitutional questions. Is the U.S. executive branch permitted to deport individuals—especially those with pending legal proceedings—to foreign detention centers with documented rights violations? What are the limits of executive discretion under immigration law in cases like this? How should the courts respond if executive agencies defy their rulings in practice, even if not openly? Is this a violation of constitutional protections, or a legally ambiguous action within the bounds of current statutes?  It also raises broader questions about precedent. Could this approach expand in scope—using foreign penal systems to detain individuals without U.S. oversight? How does this compare to historical practices like extraordinary rendition, and does it reflect a shift in the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive?  Would appreciate thoughts or historical/legal context from those familiar with similar cases.;legal political implication deport asylum seeker cecot despite federal court order weekend trump administration deport approximately venezuelan migrant el salvador individual reportedly pende asylum hearing deportation occur federal judge issue order halt accord administration official order bind plane leave airspace deportee send el salvador centro de confinamiento del terrorismo cecot large scale prison describe international human right organization overcrowded isolate operate meaningful process report indicate detainee hold near total lockdown deny communication lawyer family guarantee individual trial situation raise legal constitutional question executive branch permit deport individual especially pende legal proceeding foreign detention center document right violation limit executive discretion immigration law case like court respond executive agency defy ruling practice openly violation constitutional protection legally ambiguous action bound current statute raise broad question precedent approach expand scope foreign penal system detain individual oversight compare historical practice like extraordinary rendition reflect shift balance power judiciary executive appreciate thought historical legal context familiar similar case;Gregaros;54;0.89;92;2025-03-22 19:19:07;US Politics;0

Constituents seem to be coming out against certain DOGE actions such as its approach to the Social Security administration, Medicaid, and other programs.

1jgviw0;PoliticalDiscussion;Is Democrats/the Left's association with Tesla protests and vandalism/arson helpful or hurtful politically?;Since Elon Musk became the instigator of DOGE, many Democrats and those on the Left have protested him involvement in the Trump administration's efforts to tackle waste, fraud and abuse as they see it. Once amplified by Redditors, the backlash against Musk has spread to the mainstream, where disapproval of Musk can be seen in the declining sales of Tesla cars, the fallen stock price and more recently protests and boycotts that have in some cases led to vandalism, arson, fire-bombings and other acts of domestic terrorism.

Who stands to benefit the most from this shift, and why have Republicans been pushing for this for the past 45 years?  Are the states prepared to take on this responsibility, or are they being set up for failure with such a sudden move?      EDIT: Perhaps 'control' wasn't the right word here.

1jfn00w;PoliticalDiscussion;Could interstate pacts replace federal departments?;Could interstate pacts replace federal departments?      The idea is to form interstate pacts for those states which want to keep the same policies, funding and functions as a substitute for federal departments. This would speak to the flexibility of the U.S. federated system as interstate compacts are agreements between two or more states that allow them to collaborate on issues of mutual concern. These agreements are legally binding and often require Congressional approval if they affect federal interests, although with the federal government receding, it would imply they have no interest.      In theory, states could form pacts to replicate the functions of certain federal departments that might be abolished or downsized. For example:      * Education: States could band together to maintain a unified set of educational standards, testing, and funding mechanisms.      * Environment: States could work collaboratively to manage environmental issues that cross state borders, such as air and water pollution or wildlife conservation.      * Transportation: States could pool resources for infrastructure projects like highways or public transit that extend beyond one state.      However, there are significant challenges. Federal departments often serve as central authorities that ensure uniformity and equity across the nation. Without this oversight, disparities could emerge between states. Moreover, the loss of federal funding and expertise might strain state resources, especially for smaller or less wealthy states, although since people live in states, if fired from federal jobs, their state might hire them into a comparable job, e.g. what New York is currently doing.;interstate pact replace federal department interstate pact replace federal department idea form interstate pact state want policy funding function substitute federal department speak flexibility federate system interstate compact agreement state allow collaborate issue mutual concern agreement legally bind require congressional approval affect federal interest federal government recede imply interest theory state form pact replicate function certain federal department abolish downsize example education states band maintain unified set educational standard testing funding mechanism environment states work collaboratively manage environmental issue cross state border air water pollution wildlife conservation transportation states pool resource infrastructure project like highway public transit extend state significant challenge federal department serve central authority ensure uniformity equity nation oversight disparity emerge state loss federal funding expertise strain state resource especially small wealthy state people live state fire federal job state hire comparable job new york currently;mycall;6;0.61;36;2025-03-20 11:46:54;US Politics;0

1jetdh4;PoliticalDiscussion;Are culture wars (gender identity, immigration, etc.) used to divert attention from class struggle?;   Some political theorists argue that culture wars—such as debates over gender identity, immigration, and consumer politics—are intentionally used by political and economic elites to divert attention from class struggle. This idea is rooted in the concept of class conflict diversion, where issues of identity and social division are amplified to prevent class consciousness and collective action against economic inequality.  For example, during Donald Trump’s presidency, cultural issues like immigration, transgender rights, and NFL protests were frequently in the spotlight. Critics argue that this focus helped shift public attention away from economic policies such as tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation, which primarily benefited corporations and the upper class. By emphasizing cultural conflicts, did Trump and similar political figures prevent a broader discussion on wealth inequality?  Do you think culture wars function as a distraction from economic issues, or do they represent legitimate struggles that exist alongside class struggle? How should socialist or labor movements engage with these issues?  ;culture war gender identity immigration etc divert attention class struggle political theorist argue culture war debate gender identity immigration consumer politic intentionally political economic elite divert attention class struggle idea root concept class conflict diversion issue identity social division amplify prevent class consciousness collective action economic inequality example donald trump presidency cultural issue like immigration transgender right nfl protest frequently spotlight critic argue focus help shift public attention away economic policy tax cut wealthy deregulation primarily benefit corporation upper class emphasize cultural conflict trump similar political figure prevent broad discussion wealth inequality think culture war function distraction economic issue represent legitimate struggle exist alongside class struggle socialist labor movement engage issue;Disastrous_Aside_774;140;0.87;170;2025-03-19 09:54:00;US Politics;0

1jeolai;PoliticalDiscussion;Global Perspectives on Serbia’s Anti-Corruption Protests?;Hello everyone,  Over the past several months, Serbia has experienced significant anti-corruption protests that have drawn international attention. These demonstrations were sparked by a tragic incident in November 2024, where the collapse of a train station roof in Novi Sad resulted in the deaths of 15 individuals. The disaster exposed deep concerns regarding government corruption and negligence, prompting widespread public outcry.  The protests were initially sparked by students, who have played a significant role in leading the movement. In the aftermath of the tragedy, students across Serbia began organizing protests, closing universities, and demanding transparency and accountability from the government. Their main message was clear: they weren’t seeking a change in leadership or a political takeover, but simply wanted the institutions to function properly, investigate corruption, and serve the public’s interests. Their fight was about ensuring justice for the victims of the Novi Sad disaster and tackling systemic corruption.  However, things took an unexpected turn when a group of people posing as students began protesting against the initial student movement. These so-called “students” claimed that universities should reopen and that education should not be interrupted. It was later uncovered that these individuals were actually paid by the government to act as if they were students opposing the protests. They were, in fact, part of a broader attempt to delegitimize the genuine student movement.  In response to the growing protests, President Aleksandar Vučić dismissed the anti-corruption protests as part of a “colorful revolution” (“obojena revolucija”), suggesting that they were orchestrated and politically motivated. He attempted to downplay the gravity of the situation, further claiming that the protests were being manipulated by foreign forces or political rivals in an effort to destabilize his government.  Despite these attempts to undermine the movement, the protests gained significant momentum. On March 15, 2025, an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 (Non-political news outlets said there were about a million people.) people gathered in Belgrade, marking a historic demonstration under the slogan “15 for 15,” calling for accountability and an end to corruption. The protesters, which included not only students but also teachers, artists, and ordinary citizens, emphasized their desire for reform without seeking to overthrow the current leadership. They simply wanted the institutions to function as they should, without corruption or interference.  Allegations also surfaced regarding the use of sonic weapons by security forces to disperse peaceful protesters, prompting calls for independent investigations. President Vučić has denied these claims and suggested involving international agencies to probe the accusations.  Prime Minister Miloš Vučević resigned in January 2025, partially due to the pressure from these protests. (It is said that he resigned due to the fact that the thugs who beat up some students were closely related to him, and that they were rewarded with large sums of money.) It was found that however, many citizens feel that this step alone does not address the deep-rooted issues of corruption, and they continue to demand substantial reforms.  Given the current situation, I’d love to hear your thoughts on these questions: 	1.	What do you think the people of Serbia should do next to maintain the momentum of the protests and push for real change? 	2.	How do you think these protests will ultimately end—will they lead to real reforms or fade away without lasting impact? 	3.	What role do you think the international community should play in supporting or responding to the situation in Serbia? 	4.	How do you feel about the government’s response to the protests, especially calling them a “colorful revolution” and labeling the student movement as politically motivated? 	5.	What do you think the protesters should do next to avoid being manipulated by political forces and continue their push for accountability?  I look forward to a thoughtful and respectful discussion on this issue.;global perspectives serbia anti corruption protest hello past month serbia experience significant anti corruption protest draw international attention demonstration spark tragic incident november collapse train station roof novi sad result death individual disaster expose deep concern government corruption negligence prompt widespread public outcry protest initially spark student play significant role lead movement aftermath tragedy student serbia begin organize protest close university demand transparency accountability government main message clear seek change leadership political takeover simply want institution function properly investigate corruption serve public interest fight ensure justice victim novi sad disaster tackle systemic corruption thing take unexpected turn group people pose student begin protest initial student movement call student claim university reopen education interrupt later uncover individual actually pay government act student oppose protest fact broad attempt delegitimize genuine student movement response grow protest president aleksandar vučić dismiss anti corruption protest colorful revolution obojena revolucija suggest orchestrate politically motivated attempt downplay gravity situation claim protest manipulate foreign force political rival effort destabilize government despite attempt undermine movement protest gain significant momentum march estimate non political news outlet say million people people gather belgrade mark historic demonstration slogan call accountability end corruption protester include student teacher artist ordinary citizen emphasize desire reform seek overthrow current leadership simply want institution function corruption interference allegation surface use sonic weapon security force disperse peaceful protester prompt call independent investigation president vučić deny claim suggest involve international agency probe accusation prime minister miloš vučević resign january partially pressure protest say resign fact thug beat student closely related reward large sum money find citizen feel step address deep root issue corruption continue demand substantial reform give current situation love hear thought question think people serbia maintain momentum protest push real change think protest ultimately end lead real reform fade away last impact role think international community play support respond situation serbia feel government response protest especially call colorful revolution label student movement politically motivated think protester avoid manipulate political force continue push accountability look forward thoughtful respectful discussion issue;little_cat3;14;1.0;2;2025-03-19 04:02:39;International Politics;0

1jekmok;PoliticalDiscussion;How is Trump Getting Away with Everything?;" I’ve been following the Trump situation for years now, and I can't wrap my head around how he's managed to avoid any real consequences despite the sheer number of allegations, investigations, and legal cases against him. From the hush money scandal to the classified documents case, to the January 6th insurrection — it feels like any other politician would have been crushed under the weight of even *one* of these.  I get that Trump's influence over the Republican Party and the conservative media machine gives him a protective shield, but how deep does this go? Are we talking about systemic issues with the legal system, political corruption, or just strategic maneuvering by Trump and his team?  For context:   📌 Trump was impeached *twice* — first for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, and then for inciting the Capitol riot — yet he was acquitted both times because Senate Republicans closed ranks.   📌 The classified documents case (where Trump allegedly kept top-secret files at Mar-a-Lago) seemed like an open-and-shut case, yet it's been bogged down in procedural delays and legal loopholes.   📌 The New York hush money case involved falsifying business records to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels — something that would likely land an average citizen in jail — but Trump seems untouchable.   📌 The Georgia election interference case (pressuring officials to ""find"" votes) looks like outright criminal behavior, yet Trump is still able to campaign without serious repercussions.  📌 Trump's administration recently invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, directly defying a judicial order halting such actions. The administration argued that verbal court orders aren't binding once deportation planes leave U.S. airspace, a stance that has left judges incredulous.   📌Trump's recent actions have intensified conflicts with the judiciary, showcasing attempts to wield unchallenged presidential authority. For instance, he proceeded with deportations despite court blocks, reflecting a strategy of making bold decisions and addressing legal challenges afterward.  📌 In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed within their core constitutional duties, and at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of their responsibilities. This ruling has significant implications for holding presidents accountable for their actions while in office  It seems like Trump benefits from a mix of legal stall tactics, political protection, and public perception manipulation.

Ten Senate Democrats voted for the bill, allowing the bill to pass, 62-38, and be sent to President Trump for his signature.   [Congressional Democrats had received pressure](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5139561-democrats-shutdown-republicans-concessions/) from their supporters to vote against the bill and be willing to let the government shut down in order [to highlight the Republican Party's policies, preserve federal programs, and affirmatively place limits on the Trump Administration's abiility to make unilateral decisions. ](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/13/government-shutdown-senate-democrats-dilemma/82362462007/)  Earlier in week, [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) told reporters](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/14/government-shutdown-2025-senate-vote-trump-democrats/82317937007/):  >""If we go into a shutdown, and I told my caucus this, there's no offramp.

Currently, Republicans control both chambers of Congress, as well as the Presidency. Mid-term voters have typically registered dissatisfaction with the federal government by curtailing the power of then current majorities, particularly when the President's party holds a majority of the seats.  After Friday's vote, Schumer further explained that he, along with several other Democrats, gave assenting votes because they were concerned that voters would blame the Democratic Party for the shutting down of the federal government or partly attribute the dysfunction of the federal government to actions their party has taken.

1jcv7j6;PoliticalDiscussion;Is the Democratic Party's 'Abundance Movement' a Bold Vision for Progress or a Neoliberal Trojan Horse?;The Democratic Party's emerging 'Abundance Movement' has sparked intense debate among progressives and centrists alike. Proponents argue that this initiative aims to rejuvenate America's infrastructure, technological innovation, and economic growth by streamlining regulations and embracing large-scale development projects. However, critics contend that this approach may undermine environmental protections and social equity, echoing neoliberal ideologies under the guise of progressivism.​  Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson's forthcoming book, *Abundance*, delves into this ideology, highlighting how America's self-imposed scarcities result from regulatory complexities and a cultural shift away from building and innovation. They advocate for a proactive government that embraces technological advancements and infrastructure development to foster economic growth and societal well-being. ​  This perspective raises concerns among environmentalists and social justice advocates. The push for rapid development often clashes with environmental regulations designed to protect communities and ecosystems. Critics argue that streamlining these regulations could lead to environmental degradation and exacerbate social inequalities.   Historically, the Democratic Party has grappled with the tension between Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian visions for America. Alexander Hamilton advocated for a strong central government focused on industrial and infrastructural development, while Thomas Jefferson favored agrarianism and limited federal intervention. The Abundance Movement's alignment with Hamiltonian ideals prompts questions about the party's current direction and its commitment to grassroots democracy.

From an outsider’s perspective, this seems like a major geopolitical shift. But I’m curious: do Americans actually support this idea? Is there a real sentiment among the public that the U.S. should distance itself from Europe and realign with Russia? Or is this just a narrative pushed by certain political figures and media outlets?  I have to say that in Italy the situation is peculiar, since the end of World War II we have always been heavily influenced both from the west and from the east, and in recent decades, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Communist Party, only from the west. This presence has made us dependent on the United States, sometimes even against our direct interests.  I’d love to hear different perspectives, whether from conservatives, liberals, or independents.

This was not the case last year when the Liberals were falling behind in polls by double digits. But Trump changed all of that.  Which begs the question: Why did the Liberals benefit from Trump's threats and not the Conservatives? You can imagine a scenario where Trump's tariffs makes Canadians further sour on the Liberals and they drop further down in polling as incumbents. But that didn't happen, and the opposite occurred (as shown by polls).   So why did the Liberals benefit politically from Trump's threats but not the Conservatives?

If such an action is deemed unconstitutional by the courts, it could demonstrate that our system remains robust, capable of upholding checks and balances and maintaining an even separation of powers.

Conveniently, the 3 Democrats who voted for this and are up for re-election in 2026 (Peters, Shaheen and Durbin) have either announced their retirement or are expected to announce their retirement.   Rep. Thomas Massie was the sole House Republican to vote against the bill. On March 11th, he stated on Twitter that Senate Democrats already cut a deal with Republicans and they will vote for the bill. Massie stated in a Twitter video: ""I thought you’d like to know about the fake fight going on in the House of Representatives right now over this CR. They are trying to pitch it as a conservative CR versus liberal Democrats, and even the Democrats are going along in the House. But let me tell you why that’s a fake fight. They plan to pass it with all the Republicans here in the House but after we leave town, the Democrats are going to vote for it in the Senate. That’s right, they’re going to need about eight Democrats to vote for this thing over in the Senate. That means that this deal has already been cut, that Mike Johnson has cut a deal with the Senate Democrats, Senate leadership and even Hakeem Jeffries—he’s in on this. So that they can pitch their fake fight here in the House."" He argued that Mike Johnson sending Representatives home a day early is proof that Johnson knows a deal has been cut with Senate Democrats: ""If you thought there was really a threat of them not passing it in the Senate, why would you leave town?""  During Biden's term, Senator Kyrsten Sinema and Senator Joe Manchin were consistently the two holdouts on passing Democratic legislation. Senator Joe Lieberman was notoriously the sole Democrat (turned Independent) that blocked the public option in President Obama's Affordable Care Act.  Definition of Rotating Villain:  >In American democracy, when the majority party has enough votes to pass populist legislation, party leaders designate a scapegoat who will refuse to vote with the party thereby killing the legislation. The opposition is otherwise inexplicable and typically comes from someone who is safe or not up for re-election. This allows for maximum diffusion of responsibility.  >*""WHAT? Senator Lieberman now opposes the same health care compromise he himself suggested. Just when everyone thought Democrats had enough votes to get this done. Guess they made Lieberman the rotating villain...""*  Those who believe in the rotating villain theory argue that Lieberman played that role during the Obama years.

1jbal6r;PoliticalDiscussion;How does Republican’s bill slashing a billion dollars from DC’s own local funding affect DC’s future? Will this empower DC’s statehood movement, will Maryland take in DC as part of its own state?;Republicans are poised to pass a CR this week that is poised to cut a lot of federal jobs and slash a billion dollars from DC’s own budget:  > The stopgap funding bill being considered by the Senate would be the third continuing resolution (CR) for fiscal 2025, which began in October. While there are some funding boosts and cuts in the bill, it keeps funding largely at fiscal 2024 levels.  >A key difference between this CR and previous ones is that it is missing language allowing D.C. to spend its local budget — which consists mostly of local tax dollars — at already approved 2025 levels. While D.C. was granted what’s known as “home rule” in the 1970s, Congress still approves its budget during the appropriations process.  >As a result, D.C. officials have said the District would be forced to spend at its fiscal 2024 levels like federal agencies would under the stopgap — despite running at its updated budget levels for roughly half a year.  > In a statement obtained by The Hill this week, the mayor’s office described the cut to D.C.’s budget as a “senseless, reckless” move that “would have devastating consequences for our nation’s capital, impacting public safety, education, and essential services.”  [Source](https://thehill.com/business/budget/5194022-dc-budget-cut-funding-bill/amp/)  It’s important to note that this billion dollars that is being cut halfway into a year are DC’s own dollars, raised by DC taxpayers. There’s a strange quirk in the law that allows Congress to approve the funding of what the local DC government already collected from its residents.   How likely is this to push the efforts of DC statehood movement? Some see this as being worse than “no taxation without representation”, and as effectively “taxation without representation or without local government services” since funding is arbitrarily frozen by Congress.   There’s another theory that because DC was once part of Maryland, and that Maryland should absorb DC into its state again.   What is likely to happen going forward? Does this week’s political nightmare for DC spark any actions going forward? Or does everyone forget about this and nothing effectively changes?  ;republican bill slash billion dollar dc local funding affect dc future empower dc statehood movement maryland dc state republican poise pass cr week poise cut lot federal job slash billion dollar dc budget stopgap funding bill consider senate continue resolution cr fiscal begin october funding boost cut bill keep fund largely fiscal level key difference cr previous one miss language allow spend local budget consist local tax dollar approve level grant know home rule congress approve budget appropriation process result official say district force spend fiscal level like federal agency stopgap despite run update budget level roughly half year statement obtain hill week mayor office describe cut budget senseless reckless devastating consequence nation capital impact public safety education essential service business dc budget cut funding bill important note billion dollar cut halfway year dc dollar raise dc taxpayer strange quirk law allow congress approve funding local dc government collect resident likely push effort dc statehood movement bad taxation representation effectively taxation representation local government service funding arbitrarily freeze congress theory dc maryland maryland absorb dc state likely happen go forward week political nightmare dc spark action go forward forget effectively change;MathGecko;104;0.92;59;2025-03-14 18:26:31;US Politics;0

The dialogue could also require a personal conversation with US President Donald Trump, the Russian leader said.  I am not sure what Putin actually wants, perhaps \[as expected\] he did not reject the offer proposed, yet his ""nuances comments"" raises significant concerns about a quick peace deal even a 30 day long only. It is possible perhaps he may agree to it after some sanctions are lifted or perhaps it will just be a long drawn out ""future talks"" while the war goes on.

1j9xd8j;PoliticalDiscussion;Mahmoud Khalil and arguments against free speech for non-citizens?;"For context, Mahmoud Khalil has been detained for possible deportation because of the Trump Administration's ire over Khalil's participation and organization of Columbia University protests against Israel's genocide in Palestine. Despite being a permanent resident and being married to a US citizen, the deportation was justified by ""national security concerns"" and his ""consequences for US foreign policy.""   My understanding of free speech is that it's a universal, inalienable right -- in fact, the Declaration of Independence asserts the God-given nature of this fundamental freedom. If US policy was morally consistent, should it not be protected to the highest extent even for non-citizens? At the end of the day, if free speech is a human right, one's citizenship status should not give the government the ability to alienate that right. I understand that it's possible for non-citizens to promote an agenda among voters that is objectively against US interests...but that already happens on internet spaces, so it's quite literally impossible for the voting populace to be immune to foreign opinions on their politics.

1j7l5ih;PoliticalDiscussion;Does the Trump administration have a Mandate? How does the closeness of the election factor in?;"Donald Trump and Project 2025 has envisioned a vast restructuring/reduction of the US government: potentially slashing whole departments without congressional approval, realigning previous trade and military alliances like NATO and USMCA, antagonizing close allies like Canada, and appointing Elon Musk, an ultra-wealthy billionaire with billions in government contracts, to identify waste and inefficiency in departments after firing the Inspector Generals responsible for doing so.

1j6llit;PoliticalDiscussion;How valid are Putin’s justifications for invading Ukraine from a historical and geopolitical perspective?;Russia’s official justifications for its invasion of Ukraine have included NATO expansion, historical ties to Ukraine, and the protection of Russian-speaking populations. But how do these claims hold up when examined through historical and geopolitical lenses?  NATO Expansion: Russia argues that NATO’s post-Cold War expansion threatens its security. However, NATO’s eastern expansion has been largely driven by the voluntary accession of former Soviet and Warsaw Pact states. Since 1997, NATO has added 14 new members, many of whom sought membership precisely due to fears of Russian aggression. Given that Ukraine was not a NATO member at the time of the invasion, does this justification hold water?  Historical Claims: Putin has repeatedly stated that Ukraine is historically a part of Russia, citing figures like Catherine the Great and the USSR era. However, Ukraine’s independence in 1991 was overwhelmingly supported in a referendum (over 90% voted in favor). Does history provide a strong enough argument for Russia’s claim, or is this a revisionist approach?  Protection of Russian-Speaking Populations: The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of oppressing Russian speakers, particularly in the Donbas. However, independent reports suggest that Russian speakers were not subject to systemic persecution. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent war in Donbas, backed by Russian forces, arguably escalated tensions rather than resolved any supposed discrimination. How legitimate is this argument in light of available data?  Given these factors, is Russia’s invasion rooted in legitimate security concerns, or is this more of a great-power move akin to historical imperialism? Furthermore, with Ukraine now firmly aligned with the West and Russia deepening ties with China, is there any realistic common ground left for negotiation, or are we in for a prolonged cold conflict?;valid putin justification invade ukraine historical geopolitical perspective russia official justification invasion ukraine include nato expansion historical tie ukraine protection russian speak population claim hold examine historical geopolitical lense nato expansion russia argue nato post cold war expansion threaten security nato eastern expansion largely drive voluntary accession soviet warsaw pact state nato add new member seek membership precisely fear russian aggression give ukraine nato member time invasion justification hold water historical claim putin repeatedly state ukraine historically russia cite figure like catherine great ussr era ukraine independence overwhelmingly support referendum vote favor history provide strong argument russia claim revisionist approach protection russian speak population kremlin accuse ukraine oppress russian speaker particularly donbas independent report suggest russian speaker subject systemic persecution annexation crimea subsequent war donbas back russian force arguably escalate tension resolve suppose discrimination legitimate argument light available datum give factor russia invasion root legitimate security concern great power akin historical imperialism furthermore ukraine firmly align west russia deepen tie china realistic common ground leave negotiation prolong cold conflict;911-terrorist;0;0.34;53;2025-03-08 17:04:41;International Politics;0

Some examples that would affect his mandate would be high inflation, stagflation, deflation, economic stagnation, corruption within his government that seriously affects him, scandals related to the president, financial fraud scandals that are related to the president or his administration, intervening in a country and the majority of the population rejects that action, invading a peaceful country and the majority of the population rejects that action, leaking of highly sensitive classified intelligence documents considered to be national security, high unemployment rate and other scandals that could affect the president's administration.

1j44628;PoliticalDiscussion;Was NATO’s Balkans Intervention Justified, and How Does It Echo in Ukraine Today?;NATO’s intervention in the Balkans, particularly the 1999 Kosovo War, aimed to halt ethnic cleansing and mass atrocities by Serbian forces under Slobodan Milošević. The operation, lacking explicit UN approval, sparked debate over its legitimacy but succeeded in stopping widespread violence and enabling Kosovo’s eventual path to self-governance. Critics argue it set a precedent for unilateral Western action, while supporters see it as a necessary humanitarian response when diplomacy failed—a tension worth revisiting in light of current conflicts.  Today’s war in Ukraine shares eerie similarities: a larger power (Russia) asserts dominance over a smaller neighbor, citing historical claims and minority protections, much like Serbia did in the Balkans. NATO’s role, however, differs—rather than direct military intervention, it provides Ukraine with arms and support to resist Russian aggression. This restraint reflects lessons from the Balkans, where NATO’s bombing campaign, while effective, strained relations with Russia and fueled long-term resentment, a dynamic still at play as Moscow frames Ukraine as a proxy war against the West.

1j4fc2g;PoliticalDiscussion;Why don’t third parties focus solely on state elections instead of national ones?;Most third-party efforts in the U.S. aim for national races—Presidency, Senate, Congress—where they rarely gain traction. Meanwhile, state governments control huge aspects of daily life, yet every state election is still dominated by the same two national parties.  Why don’t we see third parties that focus only on state elections, running candidates for governor and the state legislature without trying to compete federally (at all)? A party that exists entirely at the state level wouldn’t force voters to abandon their national party affiliations for federal races, and it could create a platform designed specifically for the state rather than copying national party agendas.  I get that **Duverger’s Law** and **First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) voting** push toward a two-party system, but wouldn’t those effects be weaker at the state level, especially in places with strong independent or swing-state voting patterns? Ballot access laws and funding could also be challenges, but are they really insurmountable compared to what national third parties face?  Are there other legal, financial, or political barriers I’m not considering? Or is it just that no one has taken a serious shot at it? Would something like this actually stand a chance of breaking through?

And there are [only an estimated 108,000 centenarians](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/09/us-centenarian-population-is-projected-to-quadruple-over-the-next-30-years/) living in the U.S., according to United Nations data, while the oldest known human being lived [to the age of 122](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/longevity-expert-3-reasons-the-worlds-oldest-person-lived-to-122.html).   >Wired magazine reported that the number of people in the 150-year age bracket [may have to do with the programming language](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/) used by the SSA, known as COBOL, or the Common Business Oriented Language.

Edit:  Thank you kindly for the discussion, I appreciate everyone's viewpoints and answers to my questions.  My personal beliefs are the status quo is taking us down the wrong path, we need to change to a more empathetic and environmentally conscious future. We need to do this nonviolently and inclusively, and the more we are active about sharing the facts the better off we will be. We need people to understand that billionaires are only there because the workers are sacrificing a majority of their labor value to keep a job and collect Social Security. If you take SS away, just like taking away pensions or losing a major investment into a stock market dive—there will be public outrage. We must rise above the violence and  always remain civil whenever possible. The pardoning of the J6 folks was a slippery slope to the protection of democracy, essentially condoning their actions because their leader is now in power... that is a threat to democracy if I have ever seen one.  That said, never be afraid to rise up from those who seek to tread on you...  I highly recommend the film Civil War from 2024.

When US government problems are inherently ingrained, a call for a Convention seems like the only alternative solution.   Democrats are adamant on the need for change, but can't do so without Congress. One solution could be creating extra branches of government [like Taiwan does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ig_plOAmRo), with one new Branch dedicated to having an impartial governmental bureaucracy. If there's a blue wave soon, calling for a Convention could be possible, but there doesn't seem to be any demand for this.   A convention could potentially restructure Congress to a more dynamic electoral system, and eliminate the inadequacies of Congress.

1j3uc4k;PoliticalDiscussion;"Trump's Joint Session to Congress focused on economic growth, push for border funding and his plans for ""peace around the globe."" Given concerns over tariffs, Musk initiated government dismantling, Ukranian ""uncertainty"" and Gaza conflict, can one or more of his visions still come to fruition?";"President Donald Trump's address this evening labeled: ""The Renewal of the American Dream,"" was full of grand visions ranging from a great national economy and global peace as well as discussing his accomplishments \[during his second term first 43 days in office\].   Trump noted he had probably accomplished more in six weeks than most presidents accomplish in 4 or even 8 years. That he had the mandate to act. Highlighting the number of Executive Orders he signed. Calling Biden the worst president in U.S. history. He blamed Biden for the price of eggs and inflation and that he left the economy in shambles and now he is working to reverse inflation by lowering the energy prices and price of gas.   He said it is called drill baby drill. He complimented Musk for eliminating appalling waste. Cting several examples such as funding DEI and assisting the undocumented and characters of Sesame Street...among many others.    He bragged about withdrawing from the Climate Change Accord and ""Corrupt World Health Organization"" ceasing all federal foreign aid and federal hiring freeze. That he brought back free speech and asserted that government censorship has ended. He touted the new name of the Gulf of Mexico and how he finished off DEI via Executive Order. And that there are now only two Genders ""Male and Female."" Trump also noted that now increasing number of soldiers guarding the Southern borders. Resulting in significant decrease of illegal immigrants. He also declared war on the Cartels and MS 13 calling them same as ISIS Terrorists.   He also promised to balance the budget. He is also calling for no tax on tips, none on social security retirement income and tax deductions for interest on car payments if made in American. Along with across-the-board tax cut \[like last time\].   He belittled the CHIPS Act and referred to Taiwan that will be investing 100 billion in a factory for CHIPS in AZ.  He also talked of new tariffs in the future against Brazil, India and EU calling it reciprocal tariffs beginning April 2, 2025. Tariffs have already been imposed and include Canada, China and Mexico. Trump asserted that tariffs protect American jobs and helps the economy.   Trump also mentioned that Ukraine is now ready to sign the mineral deal under his leadership and that he will build on the Abrams Accord in the Middle East. Trump added towards the end of his speech that he was saved in Butler by God to make America Great Again.   Observers, however, express concerns over tariffs as they mount in a tit for tat trade war escalating with Canada, Mexico and China \[and EU under threat of trade war as well\], could weigh on the U.S. economy adversely impacting the national economy and the world at large, absent a quick cessation.  More specifically the U.S. imposed tariffs of 25 percent of Canadian goods with the exception for energy products, which face a 10 percent tariff. Trump also put a 25 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and an additional 10 percent on Chinese goods, raising the total to from 20 to 25%.  Within minutes of the United States hiking tariffs Beijing announced a slew of retaliatory measures. The moves included a 10-15 per cent increase in tariffs on certain US imports, export restrictions on some critical minerals, the addition of two US companies to a Chinese government blacklist, and an antitrust investigation targeting American tech giant Google. According to economists China’s moves were carefully calibrated – as some of them will hit areas that US President Donald Trump most cares about.  Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. imports and on another $86.2 billion if Trump's tariffs were still in place in 21 days. Adding that Americans will pay more for gas and groceries as a result. Separately, Premier Doug Ford canceled $100 million Starlink contract in tariff response ""It’s done, it’s gone.”  President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. She will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday in a public event in Mexico City’s Central Plaza. Perhaps, giving time to Trump to reconsider.

1j218my;PoliticalDiscussion;Shuld Ukraine be re armed with nukes?;Should Ukraine Regain Its Nuclear Arsenal? Reassessing the 1994 Budapest Memorandum  The war in Ukraine has reignited debates about nuclear deterrence, self-defense, and the reliability of international agreements. One of the most striking aspects of Ukraine’s modern history is its voluntary disarmament in 1994 when it gave up the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal in exchange for security assurances from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Given Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and the full-scale war launched in 2022, some have begun to ask: Should Ukraine be given back the nuclear weapons it surrendered?  The Budapest Memorandum: A Broken Promise?  In the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse, Ukraine inherited approximately 1,900 nuclear warheads—more than China, France, and the UK combined. However, under the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, Ukraine agreed to transfer these weapons to Russia for dismantling in exchange for guarantees of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia were the main signatories, pledging to respect Ukraine’s borders and refrain from using force against it.  But Russia violated these commitments by annexing Crimea in 2014 and launching a full-scale invasion in 2022. The lack of direct military intervention from the West raises a critical question: Would Ukraine have been invaded if it had retained its nuclear weapons?  Would a Nuclear Ukraine Have Deterred Russia?  Some analysts argue that if Ukraine had kept its nuclear arsenal, Russia would have never dared to attack. Nuclear deterrence, as seen in the Cold War, relies on the idea that the threat of massive retaliation prevents aggression. If Ukraine had retained even a small portion of its warheads, it could have presented a significant threat to Moscow, making Russian intervention much riskier.  Others counter that nuclear weapons require advanced security, maintenance, and delivery systems—capabilities that Ukraine lacked in the 1990s. Additionally, Ukraine would have faced diplomatic and economic isolation if it had refused to disarm, similar to North Korea. The West’s willingness to integrate Ukraine into international institutions might have been severely limited if it had remained a nuclear power.  Should Ukraine Be Re-Nuclearized?  Given the clear failure of the Budapest Memorandum, some propose that Ukraine should be allowed to rebuild its nuclear deterrent—either by developing its own weapons or by receiving them from Western allies. This could create a balance of power in Eastern Europe and force Russia to rethink its military strategy.  However, there are several challenges to this idea:  1. International Treaties: Ukraine is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which legally binds it to remain non-nuclear. A return to nuclear weapons would require withdrawing from the treaty, which could trigger global instability.   2. Western Opposition: NATO and the European Union generally oppose nuclear proliferation. Even though Ukraine’s case is unique, providing it with nuclear weapons could set a dangerous precedent.   3. Escalation Risks: Russia has frequently used nuclear threats to deter Western intervention in Ukraine. If Ukraine became nuclear-armed, it could provoke even more aggressive action from Moscow.    Alternative Paths to Security  If nuclear weapons are not a viable option, what alternatives does Ukraine have to ensure its long-term security?  NATO Membership: Many believe Ukraine’s best protection is full integration into NATO, where Article 5 guarantees collective defense. However, NATO has been hesitant to accept Ukraine while it is still at war.  Enhanced Western Military Aid: Some argue that providing Ukraine with long-range missiles, air defense systems, and other advanced weaponry could serve as a substitute for nuclear deterrence.  Security Guarantees from Nuclear Powers: The U.S. and its allies could offer stronger security commitments, including permanent troop deployments or nuclear-sharing arrangements similar to those in Germany and Turkey.   Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale for Other Nations?  Ukraine’s experience serves as a stark warning to countries considering nuclear disarmament. The lesson is clear: security assurances are only as strong as the willingness of signatories to enforce them. If agreements like the Budapest Memorandum can be ignored, will other nations—such as Taiwan or South Korea—be willing to trust international promises?  While the return of nuclear weapons to Ukraine remains unlikely, the debate highlights the need for stronger security guarantees for non-nuclear states. If the world expects nations to give up their nuclear arsenals, it must ensure they are genuinely protected. Otherwise, Ukraine may not be the last country to reconsider the value of nuclear deterrence.  ;shuld ukraine armed nuke ukraine regain nuclear arsenal reassess budapest memorandum war ukraine reignite debate nuclear deterrence self defense reliability international agreement striking aspect ukraine modern history voluntary disarmament give world large nuclear arsenal exchange security assurance russia united states united kingdom give russia invasion ukraine scale war launch begin ask ukraine give nuclear weapon surrender budapest memorandum broken promise wake soviet union collapse ukraine inherit approximately nuclear warhead china france uk combine budapest memorandum security assurances ukraine agree transfer weapon russia dismantle exchange guarantee territorial integrity sovereignty united states united kingdom russia main signatory pledge respect ukraine border refrain force russia violate commitment annex crimea launch scale invasion lack direct military intervention west raise critical question ukraine invade retain nuclear weapon nuclear ukraine deter russia analyst argue ukraine keep nuclear arsenal russia dare attack nuclear deterrence see cold war rely idea threat massive retaliation prevent aggression ukraine retain small portion warhead present significant threat moscow make russian intervention risky counter nuclear weapon require advanced security maintenance delivery system capability ukraine lack additionally ukraine face diplomatic economic isolation refuse disarm similar north korea west willingness integrate ukraine international institution severely limited remain nuclear power ukraine nuclearized give clear failure budapest memorandum propose ukraine allow rebuild nuclear deterrent develop weapon receive western ally create balance power eastern europe force russia rethink military strategy challenge idea international treaties ukraine signatory non proliferation treaty npt legally bind remain non nuclear return nuclear weapon require withdraw treaty trigger global instability western opposition nato european union generally oppose nuclear proliferation ukraine case unique provide nuclear weapon set dangerous precedent escalation risk russia frequently nuclear threat deter western intervention ukraine ukraine nuclear armed provoke aggressive action moscow alternative paths security nuclear weapon viable option alternative ukraine ensure long term security nato membership believe ukraine good protection integration nato article guarantee collective defense nato hesitant accept ukraine war enhance western military aid argue provide ukraine long range missile air defense system advanced weaponry serve substitute nuclear deterrence security guarantees nuclear powers ally offer strong security commitment include permanent troop deployment nuclear share arrangement similar germany turkey conclusion cautionary tale nations ukraine experience serve stark warning country consider nuclear disarmament lesson clear security assurance strong willingness signatory enforce agreement like budapest memorandum ignore nation taiwan south korea willing trust international promise return nuclear weapon ukraine remain unlikely debate highlight need strong security guarantee non nuclear state world expect nation nuclear arsenal ensure genuinely protect ukraine country reconsider value nuclear deterrence;zelotakelazam;84;0.83;171;2025-03-02 20:57:37;International Politics;0

1j29yb9;PoliticalDiscussion;If a law were proposed that heavily disincentivized work/commerce on a Sunday in order to highlight it as a family/religious day, would more Republicans vote for it because it promotes family values, or would more Democrats vote for it because it reduces labor exploitation?;"Let's say the law required mandatory triple time for any worker working on a Sunday in order to have an economic incentive to prevent it. I'm wondering who it would appeal to more.  Conservative politicians and AM radio hosts and podcasters often point to things like how Sunday became ""just another day"" as a data point for the downfall of Western civilization and religiosity and so on. However, they really dislike the government imposing their will on private companies. However, I have never seen a conservative explain to me how they expect work culture to voluntarily take a step back and have people en masse retreat from the rat race in favor of family values.  Liberal politicians and podcasts are in favor of reduced work hours per week. Its often cited how productivity has risen so much, yet work culture has us racing to the bottom in sacrificing more and more of our time to the job market. Having a national requirement for a day off and incentivizing neighbors to socialize and parents to throw the ball in the yard with their kids would lead to a happier, more well rested country. However, the left does tend to resist anything that's couched in a traditionalist lens, like the significance of a Sunday as the day of rest. Additionally, there's a significant pro-business wing of the Democratic party.

I don’t think it will be pretty.”  Zelensky has often said thanks including earlier during the conference. Zelensky also expressed some reservations and need for further discussions before any deal could be signed referring to security guarantees.

1iz2f0u;PoliticalDiscussion;How should government policy balance the need for jobs with the need for cheaper goods?;  One of the key economic debates of the past few decades has been the impact of globalization on domestic industries and workers. Supporters of free trade argue that it lowers prices, increases efficiency, and promotes economic growth. Critics, however, contend that offshoring and free trade agreements have contributed to job losses in manufacturing and other sectors, leading to wage stagnation and economic insecurity for many workers.  Both major political parties have supported free trade policies at various points. For example, during his presidency, Barack Obama championed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as a way to expand trade ties, though critics argued it would encourage more offshoring of jobs. The agreement was ultimately scrapped by President Trump, who instead imposed tariffs and renegotiated NAFTA into the USMCA, aiming to protect American workers.  Trump’s tariffs have faced significant opposition from various stakeholders, including economists and business leaders, who argue that such measures could lead to increased costs for consumers and strained international relations. However, many of these critics have not offered alternative solutions to address the offshoring of jobs and the decline of domestic manufacturing.  In recent years, both left- and right-wing politicians have expressed concerns about trade agreements, outsourcing, and reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly after the economic disruptions of COVID-19. Some advocate for tariffs, reshoring incentives, or stricter trade policies to protect domestic jobs, while others warn that such measures could lead to increased costs and trade conflicts.  Given these competing perspectives, what policies do you think best balance the benefits of globalization with the need to maintain stable employment and wages for domestic workers? Were Obama’s trade policies the right approach, or did Trump’s tariffs and reshoring efforts provide a better alternative? Should the U.S. focus more on free trade or protecting domestic industries in the coming years? Additionally, what viable alternatives exist to tariffs for encouraging the reshoring of jobs and revitalizing domestic manufacturing?  ;government policy balance need job need cheap good key economic debate past decade impact globalization domestic industry worker supporter free trade argue lower price increase efficiency promote economic growth critic contend offshore free trade agreement contribute job loss manufacturing sector lead wage stagnation economic insecurity worker major political party support free trade policy point example presidency barack obama champion trans pacific partnership tpp way expand trade tie critic argue encourage offshoring job agreement ultimately scrap president trump instead impose tariff renegotiate nafta usmca aim protect american worker trump tariff face significant opposition stakeholder include economist business leader argue measure lead increase cost consumer strained international relation critic offer alternative solution address offshoring job decline domestic manufacturing recent year right wing politician express concern trade agreement outsourcing reliance foreign supply chain particularly economic disruption advocate tariff reshore incentive strict trade policy protect domestic job warn measure lead increase cost trade conflict give compete perspective policy think good balance benefit globalization need maintain stable employment wage domestic worker obama trade policy right approach trump tariff reshore effort provide well alternative focus free trade protect domestic industry come year additionally viable alternative exist tariff encourage reshoring job revitalize domestic manufacturing;TruNorth556;0;0.41;98;2025-02-27 00:07:42;US Politics;0

The citizen of Germany had cast their vote on which party will the lead the government of Germany and who will become the chancellor of Germany. The result is that the centre-right party CDU/CSU won the election by a majority, followed by the far-right party, AFD, then the social democratic party, SPD.

1ix3seg;PoliticalDiscussion;"How do we address the ""Doomer"" effect of social media on public perception of the world?";"Social media inherently rewards what we might call ""negative"" speech - posts, memes, and tweets get significantly more attention and visibility when they're complaining that something is wrong than if they're saying that things are going well.   This leads to a public perception that everything is terrible, all the time, even when things aren't so bad - what I'm referring to here as the ""Doomer"" effect.   For example, [the public narrative leading into this past election was that the economy was in terrible shape](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/most-voters-think-the-economy-is-poor-and-are-split-on-whether-trump-or-harris-can-fix-it-polls-finds).  But statistically - *truthfully* - we had a healthy economy, and had for years.   * GDP growth [had been positive and steady](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product).  * The unemployment rate [had been relatively low](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE).  * Real household incomes [were at historical highs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N).  * Homeownership rates [were steady](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RSAHORUSQ156S).  * The mortgage default rate [had been low and steady](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS).  * Credit card defaults, while experiencing a short term spike, [were still historically much lower than average](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS).  * Auto loan defaults [were historically average](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/rising-auto-loan-delinquencies-and-high-monthly-payments-20240926.html).  * Durable goods orders [were healthy](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_durable_goods_orders).  * Inflation had returned to [just about normal levels](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_inflation_rate#:~:text=US%20Inflation%20Rate%20is%20at,in%20price%20over%20a%20year.).  And yet, despite the objective facts of the economy having been robust and healthy, there's a strong argument to be made that the public perception of the opposite fueled the Democrats' loss at the polls.  It would seem that social media spin isn't just a sideshow anymore, and Doomerism can't just be laughed off. It's having real, significant impacts on the real world.  Is there a way to solve this?

1ix5u5x;PoliticalDiscussion;A group of people with the right morals can make almost any system of organization work. Imagine the opposite though. If you were to engineer the end of good government, what would you do?;Science is based on the idea that you try to deliberately challenge the conclusions and ideas of other scientists, and create experiments or studies or similar which could make or break the theories of the others. It might be disappointing to find out your idea was wrong, but if it is, we should want to know that fact, and we even benefit from it by closing all the avenues which depended on that idea being correct and leaving only the others as possible options.   We could do something similar with brainstorming political ideas. Try to act as if you were a devil's advocate, to try to find where a system breaks, which is where devil's advocate comes from (A Catholic position, appointed to try to scrutinize miracles of proposed saints to see if they could have been non miraculous for any reason they can think of). For instance, while federal judges in America are appointed for life, nothing in the constitution said anything about how long the chief justices of a court are chosen and who by, and how judges are assigned to cases (and can be unassigned), so if you wanted to undermine this process, you could give the chief justice of a court (including appeals and district courts) the power to assign a case to a judge or to change this partway through a case, and let a president or the AG appoint the chief justice for short terms of say 2 years, perhaps even with the power to change this at pleasure.

1iwfu47;PoliticalDiscussion;Many people are framing Trump's pronouncements towards allies such as Canada and Denmark as him compelling them to make greater contributions to NATO: how true is this, and do the ends justify the means?;"We all know that Trump has said that he ""wouldn't rule out"" the use of force when it comes to acquiring Greenland from Denmark.  Furthermore, we've all heard his ""51st state"" comments aimed at Canada, although he stated that he would make them bend the knee with economics (tariffs, etc.) rather than martial means.  Canadians are not happy at all, and Trudeau let slip on a hot mic that they think he means it.  The Danes are also quite alarmed and angry.    Some American commentators claim he is ""just trolling.""  Still others claim that he is saying these things in order to compell these allies to spend more on NATO, particularly in light of the Arctic sea lanes that are opening up due to climate change.  He has no intention of actually trying to expand US territory at these allied nations' expense.  It's simply a hardball negotiation tactic that he frequently used in business dealings, called 'anchoring', it's all right there in *the Art of the Deal.*  How true is that claim?  Is that really all he's trying to do, or does he have other or additional objectives?  Should the words 'annex' and 'force' be taken at face value, or should we follow the advice of taking him ""seriously but not literally""?

In addition, it feels like there are knife attacks every day. Such attacks naturally increase the approval ratings of parties such as the AfD.

1ivnssb;PoliticalDiscussion;Why is the modern Conservative movement so hostile to the idea of Conservation?;Why is it that the modern conservative movement, especially in North America, seems so opposed to conservation efforts in general. I find it interesting that there is this divergence given that Conservation and Conservative have literally the same root word and meaning. Historically, there were plenty of conservative leaders who prioritized environmental stewardship—Teddy Roosevelt’s national parks, Nixon creating the EPA, even early Republican support for the Clean Air and Water Acts. However today the only acceptable political opinion in Conservative circles seems to be unrestricted resources extraction and the elimination of environmental regulations.   Anecdotally I have interacted with many conservative that enjoy wildlife and nature however that never seems to translate to the larger Conservative political movement . Is there a potential base within the political right for conservation or is it too hostile to the other current right wing values (veneration for billionaires, destruction of public services, scepticism of academic and scientific research, etc.)?;modern conservative movement hostile idea conservation modern conservative movement especially north america opposed conservation effort general find interesting divergence give conservation conservative literally root word meaning historically plenty conservative leader prioritize environmental stewardship teddy roosevelt national park nixon create epa early republican support clean air water act today acceptable political opinion conservative circle unrestricted resource extraction elimination environmental regulation anecdotally interact conservative enjoy wildlife nature translate large conservative political movement potential base political right conservation hostile current right wing value veneration billionaire destruction public service scepticism academic scientific research etc;kamikaze44;526;0.94;314;2025-02-22 17:20:06;Political Theory;0

1ivpag0;PoliticalDiscussion;Whether or not you support Musk's DOGE, is it correct for him to blitzkrieg his actions rather than wait to deliver a report months down the line?;"Much of the frenzy around Elon Musk's DOGE initiative has been its speed in actually doing stuff by terminating contracts and laying off government employees. It's been about a month into the Trump administration and most of the political discussion has been about DOGE, both its positives and negatives.  Whether or not you agree with what DOGE is doing, do you think it is correct for his team to take action immediately rather than carefully inspect government processes and deliver a report months later? The argument for the former is that there have been dramatic results already in terms of firings and contracts cancelled. The potential resistance hasn't yet been built up internally to thwart Trump's initiatives. The argument for the latter is that a studious audit report may be more comprehensive in what it can lay out and understand from its investigations. There is also the legal argument that a more throughout plan would be held up in court, though most of the lawsuits that have enjoined DOGE and Trump's executive orders have been done so by judges appointed by Democrats. However, the problem with a report that comes out several months later, from the perspective of the Trump administration, is that it becomes much harder to implement and much easier to ignore. Most government waste finding commissions have been shelved and ignored even internal audits done by inspectors general.  What do you make of DOGE's efforts so far? Should they have proceeded cautiously or speedily? How will the public react to what they are doing?

1iupnte;PoliticalDiscussion;If Ukraine and EU ultimately survives the war, while the US withdraws support or even aligns with Russia, what will happen to the US' international alliance and standing?;I'm not American, so please forgive my lack of deep knowledge of US foreign policy. However, I'm curious about how a sudden and drastic shift in US policy under Trump administration could affect the country's long-term global standing. If the US were to withdraw support for Ukraine or even further align with Russia, **what impact would that have on its alliances and its long-term global standing?**  While Trump’s administration has already taken positions that have heavily strained relationships with traditional allies, the US's reputation as a reliable partner wasn’t exactly spotless before his tenure. Historical examples like the Kurds, Afghanistan, Republic of China (nowadays Taiwan) and South Vietnam all showcase moments where the US has been accused of abandoning allies. Yet despite this stained records, western and democratic nations have generally continued to view the US as a crucial partner, whether conomically, ideologically, or geopolitically.  Perhaps these past betrayals were overlooked or downplayed because they involved countries that weren’t powerful or strategically significant enough to fundamentally alter global alliances? Or maybe the situations were nuanced and complex, making it difficult to definitively label them as betrayals? I saw many realpolitik supporter argue that alliances persist because, at the end of the day, these nations still need the US. The noises made by Trump administration is nothing but a hiccup in long-term US global standing.  However, maybe its my lack of experience with historical events, but the potential abandonment of Ukraine... and by extension, the entire EU... feels fundamentally different to me. If Ukraine survives the war, it could emerge as one of the strongest military powers in Europe, reducing the EU’s reliance on US defense capabilities. Additionally, the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war is one of the most morally unambiguous conflicts in modern history, where the aggressor and the victim are clearly defined. From a public relations standpoint, it would be incredibly difficult for Trump or subsequent US administration to justify such a shift, even long after the war ends.  While it’s unlikely that the US would become a pariah state, what happens if it becomes deeply controversial and increasingly distrusted and despised, even among its closest allies like Canada, Mexico, EU, UK, Japan, Taiwan and more? Would such loss of credibility fundamentally alter the global order, or would pragmatism still keep the alliances intact?  Apologies if this post is a bit disorganized... this entire situation is such an incredible mess. I used to laugh at people who were exhausted from doomscrolling, but now it seems I'm one of them.;ukraine eu ultimately survive war withdraw support align russia happen international alliance standing american forgive lack deep knowledge foreign policy curious sudden drastic shift policy trump administration affect country long term global standing withdraw support ukraine align russia impact alliance long term global standing trump administration take position heavily strain relationship traditional ally reputation reliable partner exactly spotless tenure historical example like kurds afghanistan republic china nowadays taiwan south vietnam showcase moment accuse abandon ally despite stain record western democratic nation generally continue view crucial partner conomically ideologically geopolitically past betrayal overlook downplay involve country powerful strategically significant fundamentally alter global alliance maybe situation nuance complex make difficult definitively label betrayal see realpolitik supporter argue alliance persist end day nation need noise trump administration hiccup long term global standing maybe lack experience historical event potential abandonment ukraine extension entire eu feel fundamentally different ukraine survive war emerge strong military power europe reduce eu reliance defense capability additionally ongoing russo ukrainian war morally unambiguous conflict modern history aggressor victim clearly define public relation standpoint incredibly difficult trump subsequent administration justify shift long war end unlikely pariah state happen deeply controversial increasingly distrust despise close ally like canada mexico eu uk japan taiwan loss credibility fundamentally alter global order pragmatism alliance intact apology post bit disorganized entire situation incredible mess laugh people exhaust doomscrolle;johnruby;41;0.8;134;2025-02-21 12:23:55;International Politics;0

For the first time in almost 100 years, both nuclear superpowers seem to be aligned, in fact, they even appear to have a common enemy: NATO nations.    All our lives, we have believed that nuclear warfare was unlikely because of the MAD doctrine. But if the two nations that control nearly 90% of the world’s nuclear arsenal decide to use it, then mutual assured destruction might no longer be a deterrent.

1iu4rax;PoliticalDiscussion;Are we finally seeing a changing of the guard?;Congress is at historically low levels of approval with American voters today.

This issue was thrown into sharp relief when Congresswoman Kay Granger (R.Texas), who hadn't voted in the House since July '24, was discovered in late December to be living in the dementia ward of an elder care facility. Baring the passing of term limit laws, the only route to change is the public electing younger members.   Nancy Pelosi stepped down as the Democratic Party leader in the House, almost 2 years ago. Last year  Mitch McConnell announced he was relinquishing leadership of Senate Republicans. Today, McConnell's office said he will not be seeking reelection next year.   Are these isolated events, or are we finally seeing Congress's oldest members stepping back from power, making room for younger leaders?   Age was obviously a pivotal factor in the last Presidential race. Will age become a central issue in future campaigns?  Do the hyper-partisan reactions to younger members of Congress like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, (former member) Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, and Jasmine Crockett create an environment that undermines younger candidates chances of winning a Congressional election?

On September 30, 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain received a warm welcome from a cheering crowd when he returned to London after negotiations in Munich with Adolf Hitler. Chamberlain had just left a summit where he and the prime minister of France, Edouard Daladier, agreed to Hitler’s demands for Czechoslovakia to cede a portion of its territory known as the Sudetenland to Germany, in return, Hitler assured the Western Allies that he had no further territorial ambitions. Standing on the airport tarmac, the prime minister read from a statement he and the German Führer signed that morning, pledging that their new agreement was “symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.”Speaking later that day outside the Prime Minister’s Office at 10 Downing Street, Chamberlain proclaimed, “I believe it is peace for our time.” Those hopeful words soon rang hollow, as Hitler’s forces seized all of Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939.

1itdtur;PoliticalDiscussion;Why isn't Congress acting to preserve its power?;My understanding of our federal government's structure is that the Founders wanted to channel self-interest into preventing the centralization of power: create separate branches, give them the ability to knock the others down a peg, and any time a branch feels like their own power is faltering or being threatened, they can kick those checks and balances into gear and level the playing field. This separation of powers was also formulated across extremely fundamental lines: those who make the laws, those who interpret the laws, and those who execute the laws. It would be quite autocratic if any of these mixed, so they are by design separate. Such a fundamental separation also makes each branch very powerful in its own right and outlines very clearly the powers that they have. Barring momentary lapses, it seems like this experimental government has indeed succeeded in avoiding autocracy and oligarchy for some 250 years.   With this framework in mind, you'd think that Congress, even its Republicans, would be fast-acting in impeaching and removing a President who is attempting to assume huge and unprecedented levels of legislative/regulatory authority, and who obviously wants to be the sole authority on legislation. By not acting, they are acknowledging and *allowing* the loss of a great deal of their own power. Why? Were the Founders wrong? Can allegiance outweigh self-interest? Or maybe this is an extension of self-interest, Republicans think that by attaching themselves to a king or MAGA clout, they'll gain the favor thereof. So that would be self-interest that *serves* the creation of autocracy, rather than counteracts.    I guess the simpler explanation is that impeaching Trump would be politically unpopular among the Republican base, and they fear they might lose congressional elections, but what is even the value in being elected to a branch with its power stolen by the Executive?   What do you think? I'm not exactly well-studied when it comes to politics and government, so it's very likely that I'm making some naive assumptions here.;congress act preserve power understanding federal government structure founder want channel self interest prevent centralization power create separate branch ability knock peg time branch feel like power falter threaten kick check balance gear level playing field separation power formulate extremely fundamental line law interpret law execute law autocratic mixed design separate fundamental separation make branch powerful right outline clearly power bar momentary lapse like experimental government succeed avoid autocracy oligarchy year framework mind think congress republicans fast act impeach remove president attempt assume huge unprecedented level legislative regulatory authority obviously want sole authority legislation act acknowledge allow loss great deal power founder wrong allegiance outweigh self interest maybe extension self interest republicans think attach king maga clout gain favor thereof self interest serve creation autocracy counteract guess simple explanation impeach trump politically unpopular republican base fear lose congressional election value elect branch power steal executive think exactly study come politic government likely make naive assumption;Plaguehand;614;0.96;357;2025-02-19 19:14:33;US Politics;0
1ite1mq;PoliticalDiscussion;How likely is the recent rhetoric on DEI initiatives going to impact incidents of racism and extremism in the US?;I recently rewatched American History X (an absolutely superb film from the 90s that analyses the destructive and cyclical nature of hate and racism in modern America) and was struck by one scene near the end that feels eerily relevant today.  **SPOILERS**  Those who have watched the film will know it tells the story of Edward Norton's character Derek, a former Neo-Nazi who endeavours to prevent his little brother from going down the same path he did, that led him to prison for racially aggravated murder.  [Clip](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eMVysV1lp98&pp=ygUZQW1lcmljYW4gaGlzdG9yeSB4IGZhdGhlcg%3D%3D)  In a flashback, one scene shows an innocent family dinner where Derek is influenced by his father's views on recent DEI initiatives in his local fire department. The scene serves to give the audience an insight into how the seeds of Derek's later racist extremism would be planted.  It's been impossible to ignore the recent heated rhetoric that has been coming from the Trump administration, and DOGE in particular, on what they call wasteful, counterproductive, and polarising DEI initiatives. They may or may not be right to criticise them in this way (DEI, or affirmative action previously, has always generated a lot of debate emotions from both sides).  However I wonder to what extent such attacks are going to add to worsening extremism or racism, as per the clip? Opponents may well argue that it's DEI itself that has caused this racial polarisation, whatever good intentions it has.   So who is right? ;likely recent rhetoric dei initiative go impact incident racism extremism recently rewatche american history x absolutely superb film analyse destructive cyclical nature hate racism modern america strike scene near end feel eerily relevant today spoiler watch film know tell story edward norton character derek neo nazi endeavour prevent little brother go path lead prison racially aggravate murder flashback scene show innocent family dinner derek influence father view recent dei initiative local fire department scene serve audience insight seed derek later racist extremism plant impossible ignore recent heated rhetoric come trump administration doge particular wasteful counterproductive polarise dei initiative right criticise way dei affirmative action previously generate lot debate emotion side wonder extent attack go add worsen extremism racism clip opponent argue dei cause racial polarisation good intention right;CookieMagnet0;44;0.79;126;2025-02-19 19:22:47;US Politics;0

1itkqp1;PoliticalDiscussion;Should democrats wait and let public opinion drive what they focus on or try and drive the narrative on less salient but important issues?;"After 2024, the Democratic Party was in shock.  Claims of ""russian interference"" and “not my president” and pussy hats were replaced by dances by NFL players, mandates, and pictures of the bros taking a flight to fight night.  Americans made it clear that they were so unhappy with the status quo that they were willing to accept the norm breaking and lawlessness of trump.    During the first few weeks that Trump took office, the democrats were mostly absent.  It wasn’t until DOGE starting entering agencies and pushing to dismantle them, like USAID, that the democrats started to significantly push back.  But even then, most of their attacks are against musk and not Trump and the attacks from democrats are more focused on musk interfering with the government and your information rather than focusing on the agencies themselves.    This appears to be backed by limited polling that exists.  Trumps approval remains above water and voters view his first few weeks as energetic, focused and effective.  Despite the extreme outrage of democrats, the public have yet to really sour on what Trump is doing.  Most of trumps more outrageous actions, like ending birth right citizenship are clearly being stopped by the courts and not taken seriously. Even the dismantling of USAID is likely not unpopular as the idea of the US giving aid for various foreign small projects itself likely isn’t overwhelmingly popular.    Should democrats only focus on unpopular things and wait for Americans to slowly sour on Trump as a whole or should democrats try and drive the public’s opinion?  Is it worth democrats to waste calories on trying to make the public care about constitutional issues like impoundment and independence of certain agencies?

1isz4t3;PoliticalDiscussion;How should conservatives decide between conflicting traditions?;As I understand it, conservatism recommends preserving traditions and, when change is necessary, basing change on traditions. But how should conservatives decide between competing traditions?  This question is especially vital in the U.S. context. For the U.S. seems to have many strong traditions that conflict with one another.  One example is *capitalism*.  The U.S. has a strong tradition of **laissez faire capitalism**. Think of certain customs, institutions, and laws during the Gilded Age, the Roaring 20s, and the Reaganite 80s.  The U.S. also has a strong tradition of **regulated capitalism**. Think of certain customs, institutions, and laws during the Progressive Era, the Great Depression, and the Stormy 60s.  Both capitalist traditions sometimes conflict with each other, recommending incompatible courses of action. For example, in certain cases, **laissez faire capitalism** recommends weaker labor laws, while **regulated capitalism** recommends stronger labor laws.  Besides capitalism, there are other examples of conflicting traditions. Consider, for instance, conflicting traditions over immigration and race.  Now, a conservative tries to preserve traditions and make changes on the basis of traditions. How, then, should a conservative decide between conflicting traditions? Which traditions should they try to preserve, or use as the basis of change, when such traditions come into conflict?  Should they go with the older tradition? Or the more popular tradition? Or the more consequential tradition? Or the more beneficial tradition? Or the tradition most coherent with the government’s *original* purpose? Or the tradition most coherent with the government’s *current* purpose? Or some weighted combination of the preceding criteria? Or…?  Here’s another possibility. Going with either tradition would be equally authentic to conservatism. In the same way, going with either communism or regulated capitalism would be equally authentic to progressivism, despite their conflicts.;conservative decide conflicting tradition understand conservatism recommend preserving tradition change necessary base change tradition conservative decide compete tradition question especially vital context strong tradition conflict example capitalism strong tradition laissez faire capitalism think certain custom institution law gilded age roaring reaganite strong tradition regulated capitalism think certain custom institution law progressive era great depression stormy capitalist tradition conflict recommend incompatible course action example certain case laissez faire capitalism recommend weak labor law regulated capitalism recommend strong labor law capitalism example conflicting tradition consider instance conflicting tradition immigration race conservative try preserve tradition change basis tradition conservative decide conflicting tradition tradition try preserve use basis change tradition come conflict old tradition popular tradition consequential tradition beneficial tradition tradition coherent government original purpose tradition coherent government current purpose weighted combination precede criterion possibility go tradition equally authentic conservatism way go communism regulated capitalism equally authentic progressivism despite conflict;matthewmorgado;0;0.48;134;2025-02-19 06:36:56;Political Theory;0

Trump has previously argued that federal spending contributes to inflation, yet his tax plan is projected to increase the deficit by trillions of dollars due to lost revenue.

I was publicly scorned 2 years ago for using the word  “normal” to describe someone who wasn’t suffering from a psychotic break.

This person is a white female, attended an elite nyc private high school and Ivy League schools, inherited millions of dollars from their parents and identify as “they”.

1j1rpth;Republican;Andrew Klavan On China, Russia, And The Zelenskyy Meeting. Please Take Some Time To Watch This.;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqdPd1Dqn6Y  I am not one to promote any particular commentator on here and I want you, my fellow Republicans, to determine for yourselves what is and is not important to us rather than the left telling us what is important, other countries telling us what is important, or any particular faction within the Republican party. I believe YOU decide what is important.  But there is one thing I think is crucially important that so many of us here (including myself at times) miss, and that is thinking about things more historically and more the way an artist might understand the flow of history. We need the nitty gritty, we need details, we need to look at the laws, the treaties, the minor incursions... we need to zoom into history with a microscope and view all those smaller (though serious and important) details.  But we also need to pull ourselves back and view history from a broader perspective. If you are a Christian who is familiar with Biblical history (and I encourage you all to be), one thing you will see is the ebb and flow of evil and good through time. When you see history this way, you can often see what is coming and be amazed as the details fill in towards that end. So very often this has brought the proper context to help me understand moments like the oval office meeting with Trump, Vance, and Zelenskyy.  I think this particular episode of Andrew Klavan's show is so critically important because it contextualizes that event in a way that connects to history so easily, that you will understand the impact of it.  His argument (which I would go as far as to say is simply true) is that just like in WWII, we are in a world with a growing and serious existential threat. While Russia is undoubtedly bad, they have shown us historically that they are not the world domination type. Nor are we. We want to be sovereign to ourselves, and we are willing to compete, and we are willing to dominate markets and territories insofar as we need to to ensure we have the ability to be self sovereign in the face of threats like Russia and China. Russia is largely the same as us, they just do so in a messed up way as compared to us (obviously we are not perfect at this). China is not. China at this point in history wants domination of everything. They are self-sovereign, but they want more.  Russia always strikes me as Cain-like and we are more like Abel, and they are more Esau-like to our Jacob. In the Esau and Jacob story, Jacob is righteous (though imperfect) but Esau is just this kind of angry kid who loses his birthright. For time, the descendants of Esau dominate the descendants of Jacob, but that reverses.  Russia will not be a vassal to China or anyone else. Trump knows this, Putin knows this - that in the face of China, we will need each other. That does not make us friends, that does not make us respect each other. But when China moves, if the US is defeated, then Russia will be, too. If when China moves, if Russia is defeated, it may be that we are defeated, too.  There are other countries at play. I think India will play an important role. But right now, if you look at what is happening with this historical perspective and what happened in WWII, it seems Trump is trying to help cool the tensions between Russia and Ukraine because Ukraine either doesn't see or doesn't care about the threat that China is. China is a worse threat than Russia is to Ukraine and Zelenskyy doesn't seem to see that.  So to those who hate how Trump and Vance handled this meeting, please consider this. China is coming, they are poised. It is possible we can legislate and make moves that will keep them at bay, but right now they are preparing for war. Do you want to appease them like the UK did with Germany? Or do you want a leader who recognizes this threat and is trying to help everyone take some time to prepare but ending what amounts to a little spat compared to what we could see in a third world war?;andrew klavan china russia zelenskyy meeting time watch promote particular commentator want fellow republicans determine important left tell important country tell important particular faction republican party believe decide important thing think crucially important include time miss think thing historically way artist understand flow history need nitty gritty need detail need look law treaty minor incursion need zoom history microscope view small important detail need pull view history broad perspective christian familiar biblical history encourage thing ebb flow evil good time history way come amazed detail fill end bring proper context help understand moment like oval office meeting trump vance zelenskyy think particular episode andrew klavan critically important contextualize event way connect history easily understand impact argument far simply true like wwii world grow existential threat russia undoubtedly bad show historically world domination type want sovereign willing compete willing dominate market territory insofar need ensure ability self sovereign face threat like russia china russia largely mess way compare obviously perfect china china point history want domination self sovereign want russia strike cain like like abel esau like jacob esau jacob story jacob righteous imperfect esau kind angry kid lose birthright time descendant esau dominate descendant jacob reverse russia vassal china trump know putin know face china need friend respect china move defeat russia china move russia defeat defeat country play think india play important role right look happen historical perspective happen wwii trump try help cool tension russia ukraine ukraine care threat china china bad threat russia ukraine zelenskyy hate trump vance handle meeting consider china come poise possible legislate move bay right prepare war want appease like uk germany want leader recognize threat try help time prepare end amount little spat compare world war;MikeyPh;0;0.33;8;2025-03-02 14:12:43;NA;0

And what new industries they plan to create in order to offset the economic impact of firing thousands of workers. He seems to be positioning himself for dare I say it….. presidency. And why is America now so concerned with South African politics but on President Trumps campaign he has stated multiple times that America would no longer be involved in other countries politics and seems to be keeping his word except for his new vice presidents homeland. I am pretty satisfied with some of Trumps changes but I can’t shake the feeling that this will not end well.

1itno2i;Republican;Please Read - Be Diligent - A Lesson Learned From A Recent Troll Post;"There was a recent Trump meme that many of you found distasteful while others saw it as him owning what the left calls him anyway. I don't particularly like the meme myself, but if they're going to call him a despot and if he is going to keep winning for us, then I don't see much of a problem with him owning that ""king"" title as a joke.  But that is not why I'm talking about this.  A user recently posted this meme in our sub. The user seems to likely be a troll who believes that Trump is literally involved in a billionaire coup to install a fascist government. This is a stupid take, it flies in the face of reality, though we should always be on the lookout for such things.  By the way, I was going to leave the meme up and just lock the thread, because looking through the user's history it was mostly benign, and then I found a comment that showed me who they were.  The user compared Trump to Smedley Butler who was involved in a planned coup of wealthy elites (including Prescott Bush - George H.W.'s Grandfather - this is true) to overthrow the government to install a fascist  government. Smedley would have been used to arrest the current government at the time (this was under FDR) and I believe he was supposed to be the dictator - What a name for a dictator, huh? He also railed against military involved overseas among other things. The comparison is quite faulty considering many things, like how so many billionaires are against Trump and for the Democrats. But the left, they hear ""billionaire"" and think evil immediately and then create conspiracies, and unfortunately there is some real history that acts as fodder for it. Look up ""Business Plot"". And while the history is likely distorted by the left, it is not untrue.  Anyway, the user posted that meme as a troll. I am disappointed to say that it worked.  While much of the thread was full of non-Americans, leftist, moderates who hate Trump, people who keep commenting in r/antiwork and r/democrats who will always come and start trouble, our own argued with each other with a vitriol that the left deserves, not our own.  There were two sides. Those who immediately trashed the president for this meme are the most noteworthy (but I'll get to the others). And by trashed, I mean those who completely decontextualized it, some with longer comments that were nicely written, and some that said little more than ""This is dangerous"". And this is coming from someone who is absolutely concerned about authoritarianism in any party.  There were also our own who sometimes feel like they are trolling with how ride-or-die they are for Trump. And this is coming from someone who fucking loves Trump right now, even looking past this meme and what I consider to be an error on his dealings with Ukraine recently.  Anyway, there was quite a bit of arguing between these two types of our own.  Now, the motive of trolls is not always simple. But regardless of their conscious goals, discord and fighting is the result. They either sow doubt in you as an individual or they encourage infighting with their tactics.  And what's worse is that they often use legitimate things that we *should* look at to do so. I don't know about you, but I would gladly talk about that meme rationally if a fellow Republican told me about it, but if some asshole troll throws it in my face, I'm not going to want to talk about it.  That is part of this, that is part of why trolls are such pieces of shit. We can have such conversations and should have such conversations, but on our own terms and when WE deem it a problem, because you know that they see many things as problems that are not.  **Be aware of these things**. This used to be known as subterfuge but now it is just normalized internet discourse. It's not okay. Temper your arguments, check suspicious activity, check your own use of logical fallacies (because these bad discourse habits are ingrained in most of us and we don't even think twice about it), and remain as civil as possible, especially when talking about hot button issues for us. The left is fractured now, they want us to fracture, too.  Lastly, it is a logical fallacy to disregard an argument based simply on the person who made it. That said, knowing who is making posts and comments and understanding their intent for bringing up their point is totally valid, especially when the user in question is just making a post and not necessarily commenting themselves, like in the case of the recent post. So when you see posts that piss you off, go ahead, look through the history of the user. I had to go pretty deep to find out about that user.  I will post a screen shot of the taken down post for your reference with the user's name blacked out (that is if I'm not too boomer-ish to do so... I still use old reddit pretty much all the time).";read diligent lesson learn recent troll post recent trump meme find distasteful see own left call particularly like meme go despot go win problem own king title joke talk user recently post meme sub user likely troll believe trump literally involve billionaire coup install fascist government stupid fly face reality lookout thing way go leave meme lock thread look user history benign find comment show user compare trump smedley butler involve plan coup wealthy elite include prescott bush george grandfather true overthrow government install fascist government smedley arrest current government time fdr believe suppose dictator dictator huh rail military involve overseas thing comparison faulty consider thing like billionaire trump democrats left hear billionaire think evil immediately create conspiracy unfortunately real history act fodder look business plot history likely distort left untrue user post meme troll disappointed work thread non americans leftist moderate hate trump people comment r antiwork r democrats come start trouble argue vitriol left deserve side immediately trash president meme noteworthy trash mean completely decontextualize long comment nicely write say little dangerous come absolutely concerned authoritarianism party feel like troll ride die trump come fuck love trump right look past meme consider error dealing ukraine recently bit arguing type motive troll simple regardless conscious goal discord fighting result sow doubt individual encourage infighte tactic bad use legitimate thing look know gladly talk meme rationally fellow republican tell asshole troll throw face go want talk troll piece shit conversation conversation term deem problem know thing problem aware thing know subterfuge normalize internet discourse okay temper argument check suspicious activity check use logical fallacy bad discourse habit ingrain think twice remain civil possible especially talk hot button issue left fractured want fracture lastly logical fallacy disregard argument base simply person say know make post comment understand intent bring point totally valid especially user question make post necessarily comment like case recent post post piss ahead look history user pretty deep find user post screen shot take post reference user black boomer ish use old reddit pretty time;MikeyPh;53;0.66;68;2025-02-20 02:21:15;NA;0

1irmooh;Republican;Why bother negotiating an Ukraine treaty if we won’t be involved no matter the outcome.;Hey guys genuine question here that I wasn’t allowed to post in r/askconservatives , probably due to their sub being spammed with Ukraine and Trump related questions and assumed I was a troll or something. Anyways I’m genuinely curious and want to know what my fellow Conservatives think. What’s the point of Trump negotiating a peace treaty in Ukraine if he doesn’t plan on America doing anything in any case? You would assume if America’s negotiating we’d be somewhat involved be it with sending troops to help administer a neutral zone or to guarantee Ukraine post-war but Trump has stated he does not intend for America do either or increase aid for Ukraine if the deal fails. If this is the case why even bother negotiating if we’re not going to get involved no matter the outcome? For the sake of being world-police? Also why should Ukraine accept any deal they view unfavorable now if they know the U.S. won’t support them even if they did sign the deal and why would Russia accept a deal if they know America won’t aid Ukraine anymore even if they don’t end the war? I just don’t see any point in Trump negotiating if America doesn’t have any involvement on the outcome, either just pull out and let them deal with it or actually have America involve itself in the outcome.

1irdvet;Republican;Is this really a justifiable cut?;I've been on board with cuts and investigation the Trump administration has been doing.. but I'm having a hard time understanding how this one is helpful. I'm heartily in favor of funding scientific research. This is limiting lab and equipment expenditures, a necessary part of that research.   I'm not saying there aren't issues with the NIH that should be addressed. For one, there's loads of studies that we fund and the results arent made public. Publicly funded research should be required to be published. But this isn't addressing that.   If there's corruption, or conflict of interest issues, wouldn't requiring greater transpiracy of funds be the solution? And firing those that abuse it? Not this?   If its that we don't want to waste money on pointless studies, wouldn't a crack down and more clarified policy on what research can be funded be the solution?  The only other argument I've seen is that universities are cutting themselves a portion of this money. But do we know that, and if so, how? I've seen a couple of comments on YouTube videos from people allegedly in university administration positions saying the funds from the grants are razor thin and well accounted for. Not a very official source, I know -- where else can I look into that?  Does anyone have a good argument in favor of this?;justifiable cut board cut investigation trump administration have hard time understand helpful heartily favor fund scientific research limit lab equipment expenditure necessary research say issue nih address load study fund result not public publicly fund research require publish address corruption conflict interest issue require great transpiracy fund solution fire abuse want waste money pointless study crack clarify policy research fund solution argument see university cut portion money know see couple comment youtube video people allegedly university administration position say fund grant razor thin account official source know look good argument favor;Anon_2425;56;0.7;55;2025-02-17 06:50:08;Discussion;0
1ir7u5b;Republican;New Rules and Changes - And Brief Explanations;We have 2 new rules that may be consolidated or adjusted. You'll have to excuse my boomerishness, but with New Reddit and some other changes (I still prefer Old Reddit) some of what we used to do has shifted. Some of these thing I think can be coded, but I am learning how. Again, forgive my ignorance.  Anyway, one major problem that we have had in the past is that videos, text posts, and image posts, if unchecked, were often troll posts that not only meant to mock us, but also intended to get us shut down. If some bad actors on alt accounts created racist memes to throw on our sub and we weren't diligent enough in taking them down, the sub could get shut down.   That is why we only allowed article posts from the subs inception, and it remained an unspoken rule. But things started shifting and there were little changes to posts that reddit made, and then new reddit happened and we mods just didn't adjust to the times perhaps? That's my excuse anyway.  People started posting links in text posts, which I thought was a mistake and we tried to correct it, but it was just a pain in the ass. They started posting text commentary under articles, which never used to happen.  So the issue is thus: too little oversight into posts leads to  * Shit posts (And I mean shit) * Trolls having too easy a time to troll * Bad actors using bad posts to try and get us shut down or promote brigading that just ruins the experience of our users.  These new rules are to force commentary where it belongs, in the comment section. If you want to make a comment about your article, just make it in the comment section, don't change the title to comment on an article, and don't comment on the article in any body section (I think I changed that so you won't be able to).  **Forcing the commentary into the comment section allows you users to protect from the problems that that causes while allowing for the** ***same*** **commentary**. So do not complain about free speech on this front. Protestors have to follow rules, too, they are supposed to get permits, they are not allowed to just disrupt everything... at least anywhere other than blue cities.  This also prevents an annoying trend I've been seeing where users post a link to Google. Not a Google article. Not some app on Google to comment on the app in some relevant way, just posting a link to Google so that they can then make a comment in what becomes a text post.  Hopefully I have removed that ability so the rule is moot.  We also hope to allow more things like text posts, video posts, and other posts. But that requires moderation. I can't tell you how many times such posts in the past were used to troll, brigade, and try to hurt us. An innocuous photo of Trump and the First Lady one posted here had a photoshopped silhouette of the twin towers on fire in the patter of Melania's dress or Trump's tie (I forget which).

1jqo1ft;politics;I’m Greta Bedekovics, the associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress. I previously worked in the U.S. Senate on voting rights and election security. Ask me anything about the SAVE Act and Trump’s EO to restrict voting.;I'm the associate director of democracy policy at CAP. Prior to joining CAP, I worked on Capitol Hill as a policy adviser for the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for Sen. Amy Klobuchar. I worked extensively on voting rights, election security and administration, foreign election interference, dark money, and democracy legislation—including the Freedom to Vote Act.  Most recently, I have worked on sounding the alarm on the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, federal legislation that would require all Americans to show documentary proof of citizenship, in person, when they register to vote and every time they update their voter registration. Under the SAVE Act, the vast majority of Americans would need to rely on a [passport or birth certificate](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-would-disenfranchise-millions-of-citizens/) to prove their citizenship status. This would disenfranchise millions of eligible American citizens, and have a disproportionate impact on [rural](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-would-force-many-rural-americans-to-drive-hours-to-register-to-vote/) and low-income Americans as well as married women. 146 million Americans do not have a passport and as many as 69 million married women do not have a birth certificate they could use to register to vote. You can read my analysis on the SAVE Act [here](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-would-disenfranchise-millions-of-citizens/). I have also been quoted in [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/save-act-voter-registration-citizenship-married-women-name-change/), USA today, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5301676/save-act-explainer-voter-registration), [the Associate Press](https://apnews.com/article/save-act-voting-proof-citizenship-new-hampshire-5105986c3fc354d3d61ec3480b49c788), [the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/trump-is-still-trying-to-undermine-elections), [Ms. Magazine](https://msmagazine.com/2025/02/11/safe-act-voter-registration-women-black-voting-rights/), and [the Dispatch](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-about-the-save-act/).  Despite Congress agreeing to consider this legislation the week of March 31, on March 25, President Trump [bypassed Congress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-executive-order-on-elections-aims-to-dictate-how-states-run-elections-and-handpicks-which-citizens-can-vote/) and signed an unconstitutional [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/). in an attempt to unilaterally enact the SAVE Act. Under the EO only a passport could be reliably used by Americans to prove their citizenship status. Key parts of the EO rely on implementation by an independent agency the President has no authority over, and the EO even charges DOGE with reviewing the voter registration lists of every single state and how states maintain their voter rolls. I talk about this more in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/26/proof-citizenship-voting-explained/).  Ask me anything about the SAVE Act and Trump's executive order at 2:00PM (EST).
